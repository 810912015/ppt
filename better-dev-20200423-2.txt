It’s an online marketplace where people can buy and sell things and where no one asks too many questions. It’s basically a rip-off of Craigslist, but with Steve’s name instead of Craig’s.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/systems-cover.png\"></p>\n\n<p>You’re going to be responsible for building the entire Steveslist technical platform, including all of its websites, mobile apps, databases, and other infrastructure. You’re excited, but also very nervous. You figure that you can probably cobble together a small website, since you’ve done that a few times before as part of your previous <a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2018/07/09/how-tinder-keeps-your-location-a-bit-private/\">entertaining</a>-<a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2017/10/09/tracking-friends-and-strangers-using-whatsapp/\">if</a>-<a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2014/12/08/fun-with-your-friends-facebook-and-tinder-session-tokens/\">morally</a>-<a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2016/10/22/a-tale-of-love-betrayal-social-engineering-and-whatsapp/\">questionable</a> <a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2019/01/15/a-brief-history-of-wi-fi-privacy-vulnerabilities/\">escapades</a> with the Stevester. But you have no idea how to even start building out all of the other infrastructure and tools that you assume lie behind large, successful online platforms.</p>\n\n<p>You are in desperate need of a detailed yet concise overview of how real companies do this. How do they store their data? How do their different applications talk to each other? How do they scale their systems to work for millions of users? How do they keep them secure? How do they make sure nothing goes wrong? What are APIs, webhooks and client libraries, when you really get down to it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>You send a quick WhatsApp to your other good friend, Kate Kateberry, to see if she can help. You’ve <a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2019/01/15/a-brief-history-of-wi-fi-privacy-vulnerabilities/\">worked together very effectively in the past</a>, and she has decades of experience creating these types of systems at Silicon Valley’s biggest and most controversial companies.</p>\n\n<p>She instantly accepts your job offer. You had actually only been ringing for some rough guidance and a good gossip, but you nonetheless instantly accept her acceptance. No point looking a gift horse in the mouth, even when you don’t have any money to pay her. Kate proposes that her first day be 5 weeks ago in order to help her smooth over some accounting irregularities. She can come into the office sometime next week. You feel encouraged and threatened by her eagerness.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Kate bounces into your offices in the 19th Century Literature section of the San Francisco Public Library. “OK let’s do this!” she shouts quietly. “What have we got so far? How are all our systems set up? What’s the plan?” You lean back in your chair and close your laptop, which was not turned on because you have left your charger at home. You steeple your fingers in a manner that you hope can be described as “thoughtful”.</p>\n\n<p>“Let me flip that question around, Kate. What do <em>you</em> think the plan should be?”</p>\n\n<p>Kate takes a deep breath and paints an extremely detailed vision of the Steveslist platform five years into the future and the infrastructure that will power it.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Before we start (says Kate), I want to make it clear that I’m not saying that any of this is necessarily the “right” way to set up our infrastructure. If someone you trust more than me says something different then you should probably do what they say. There are many tools out there, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and many ways to build a technology company. The real, honest reasons that we will make many of our technological choices will be “we chose X because Sara knows a lot about X” and “we chose Y on the spur of the moment when it didn’t seem like a big decision and we never found the time to re-evaluate.”</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, let’s fast-forward five years into the future. Now Steveslist has two main consumer-facing products:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>The Steveslist web app</li>\n  <li>The Steveslist smartphone apps</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are the main ways in which users directly interact with the Steveslist platform. In addition, we also provide an API that allows programmers to build power-tools on top of the Steveslist platform that, for example, create listings for hundreds of items programmatically. To support this, we offer:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A Steveslist API</li>\n  <li>Steveslist API <em>client libraries</em> that make it easy for programmers to write code that talks to our API</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here, I’ll draw a diagram on the whiteboard:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>+-----------+   +--------------+   +-----------------+\n|Web Browser|   |Smartphone App|   |Client Libraries/|\n+-----+-----+   +------+-------+   |Other API code   |\n      |                |           +-------+---------+\n      |                v                   |\n      |          +-----+------+            |\n      +---------&gt;+ Steveslist +&lt;-----------+\n                 |  Servers   |\n                 +------------+\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Finally, we have many, many services running in the background that provide the data and power to these external-facing applications:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Webhooks - to notify users when something happens to their account, such as “order placed”</li>\n  <li>User password authentication - to securely log users in</li>\n  <li>SQL database - the main Steveslist data store. Needs to be highly scalable and reliable</li>\n  <li>Free-text searching system - to power the search box where people can look for broad search terms like “TVs” or “motorbikes”</li>\n  <li>Internal tools - to help us administer the Steveslist platform, and to take actions like issuing sternly-worded warnings to malicious users</li>\n  <li>Cron jobs - to run regular tasks that do anything from generating invoices, to billing customers, to sending as much of our users’ data as possible to third-party ad networks</li>\n  <li>“Pubsub” system - to allow us to take asynchronous actions on different trigger events (such as “when a new user signs up, send them a welcome email”)</li>\n  <li>Big data analytics system - to allow us to run enormous queries over the entirety of Steveslist’s data</li>\n  <li>And many more that we’ll talk about another day</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let’s go through each of these systems in turn. <a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/about/\">Let me know</a> if anything isn’t clear, if you have any questions, or if you think I’ve got something wrong.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"before-we-start---what-is-a-server-really\">Before we start - what is a server really?</h2>\n\n<p>Before we start, let’s define some important terms. In fact, let’s just define one. We’re going to talk a lot about “servers” today. But what is a server, when you really get down to it?</p>\n\n<p>For our purposes, a server is a computer that runs on a network and listens for communications from other computers. When it receives some data from another computer it performs some sort of action in response and - usually - sends back some data of its own. For example, a web server listens on a network for HTTP requests and sends back webpages and information in response. A database server listens for database queries and reads and writes data to the database that it is running.</p>\n\n<p>This brief description skips out entire degrees and careers of detail, and there are of course far more precise and accurate ways to define the word “server”. But this should get us through until dinnertime. What did you say? What’s a “network” really? A good question for another day.</p>\n\n<p>Now we’re ready to talk about the Steveslist platform.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steveslist-web-app\">Steveslist web app</h2>\n\n<p>This is the main Steveslist product. It’s just a normal web app, very similar to any website that you’ve built before, except much bigger. It’s a modern “single-page app” (SPA). The “single” in “single-page app” refers to the fact that the user’s browser almost never has to fully reload the page as the user clicks around our site. Instead, when the browser makes its first <em>HTTP request</em> to our servers, we send it back a basic, skeleton HTML page and a big pile of <em>JavaScript</em> code. This JavaScript code executes inside the browser, and updates the view of the page in response to the user’s actions. When the JavaScript wants to send or retrieve data from Steveslist, it sends an Asynchronous JavaScript XML Request (almost always called AJAX for short) in the background to a URL. When our server responds, the JavaScript uses the response to update the browser view accordingly.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>+----------+1.User's browser visits steveslist.com. +----------+\n|          |  It sends an HTTP request to the       |          |\n|          |  Steveslist servers                    |          |\n|          +---------------------------------------&gt;|          |\n|User's Web|                                        |Steveslist|\n| Browser  |2.Steveslist server responds with a     | Servers  |\n|          |  skeleton HTML page that instructs the |          |\n|          |  browser to request additional         |          |\n|          |  JavaScript files.                     |          |\n|          |&lt;---------------------------------------+          |\n|          |                                        |          |\n|          |3.User's browser requests and receives  |          |\n|          |  these JavaScript files from the       |          |\n|          |  Steveslist server.                    |          |\n|          +---------------------------------------&gt;|          |\n|          |&lt;---------------------------------------+          |\n|          |                                        |          |\n|          |4.User's browser executes the JavaScript|          |\n|          |  code.

They are conceptually very similar to our single-page web app. Both our smartphone and web apps make HTTP requests to our servers. Then our servers receive these requests, do some work and return an HTTP response. Finally, both our smartphone and web apps update their display in order to communicate with the user.</p>\n\n<p>Since our smartphone apps are performing the same operations as the web app (for example, create listing, send message, etc), they can usually even send their requests to the exact same URLs as the web app. The only extra work that we have to do is to develop the frontends of the apps themselves. Some frameworks even make it possible to write mobile apps using JavaScript, allowing you to reuse code and logic across platforms.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steveslist-api\">Steveslist API</h2>\n\n<p>We allow users and third-parties to write code that programmatically interacts with our platform. In the same way that people can use the Twitter API to write code that reads; likes; and creates Tweets, we allow them to use the Steveslist API to search; buy; and list items.</p>\n\n<p>Programmers use our API by writing code that makes HTTP requests to our <em>API endpoints</em>. For example, in order to retrieve a list of all their listings, the programmer sends an HTTP <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">GET</code> request to <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">api.steveslist.com/v1/listings</code>. We respond with the data they requested, formatted as <em>JSON</em>. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but JSON is not specific to JavaScript and can easily be interpreted by any programming language. A JSON response to a request to retrieve all of a user’s listings might look something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">listings</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">id</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">2178123867</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">name</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">Stolen TV</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">country</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">US</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">city</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">San Francisco</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_amount</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_currency</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">usd</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"err\">#</span> <span class=\"nx\">etc</span><span class=\"p\">...</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">},</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">id</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">182312679</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">name</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">Stolen Bicycle</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">country</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">US</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">city</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">San Francisco</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_amount</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">2000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_currency</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">usd</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"err\">#</span> <span class=\"nx\">etc</span><span class=\"p\">...</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This structured response format is very easy for a program to parse, which means that the code that made the request can trivially interpret and use the data from our API.</p>\n\n<p>Users identify or <em>authenticate</em> themselves to our API using an API key. This is, roughly speaking, the API equivalent of a password. It is a long, random string that we generate and display on a user’s “Settings” page. Users include their API key as an <em>HTTP header</em> with every HTTP request that they (or their code) makes to the API. When we receive an API request we check to see whether the attached API key corresponds to a Steveslist user. If it does then we perform the request on behalf of that user.</p>\n\n<p>If a programmer wants to, they can manually build HTTP requests to our API themselves, using their language’s standard HTTP library. For example, in Python they might write:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">requests</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">url</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">'https://api.steveslist.com/v1/listings/'</span>\n<span class=\"n\">listing_params</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Stolen TV\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"country\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"US\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"city\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"San Francisco\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"price_amount\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"s\">\"price_currency\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"usd\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"n\">api_key</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE\"</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">requests</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">post</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">url</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">listing_params</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">headers</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"X-Steveslist-API-Key\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">api_key</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>However, we make life easier for programmers by providing <em>client libraries</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"steveslist-client-libraries\">Steveslist client libraries</h2>\n\n<p>A client library is a library that “wraps” the functionality of the Steveslist API. This means that anyone using the client library doesn’t need to know anything about the fine details of the Steveslist API. Instead, they can just write:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">steveslist</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">listing</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">steveslist</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Listing</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">create</span><span class=\"p\">(</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Stolen TV\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">country</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"US\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">city</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"San Francisco\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">price_amount</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">price_currency</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"usd\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">api_key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Our libraries turn the parameters that they are given into appropriately formatted HTTP requests, which they send to the Steveslist API as normal. We’ve written client libraries for every major programming language that we could think of, and they are by far the most common way that people interact with our API.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"webhooks\">Webhooks</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve seen how Steveslist users can use our API to programmatically interact with their account. In addition, many users also want <em>us</em> to proactively tell <em>them</em> whenever something happens to their Steveslist profile. For example, suppose that someone wanted to fully automate the process of selling items on Steveslist. Whenever a customer pays for an item using our new, mostly-secure StevePay system, they want to send the customer a thank you email and automatically instruct their warehouse to ship a stolen TV to the order address. Our seller could constantly and repeatedly query the Steveslist API asking “Any new sales? Any new sales?” However, this would be very inefficient, and would put a lot of unnecessary load on our servers.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, we provide an industry standard system called <em>webhooks</em>. A webhook is an HTTP request that we send to our users whenever something interesting happens to their account. It contains all the data describing the event that just happened - for example, the item ID, the price, the buyer ID, buyer address, and so on. Webhooks allow users to automatically perform response actions, such as the aforementioned email and auto-shipping.</p>\n\n<p>To use webhooks, the user tells us the URL to which they would like us to send their webhooks (for example, <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">steveslistwebhooks.robertheaton.com</code>. They set up a web server at that URL that will receive and action these webhook notifications.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>1.Buyer purchases an      3.The seller's server receives the webhook,\n  item as normal.           and uses the information in it to\n                            automatically process the order.\n+---------------+           +-----------------+\n|Buyer's Browser|           |Seller's Webhook-+\n+------+--------+           |Receiving Server |\n       |                    +------+----------+\n       |                           ^\n       |                           | \n       |                           |   \n       |    +-----------+          |\n       +---&gt;+ Steveslist+----------+\n            |   Server  |\n            +-----------+\n       2.Once the transaction has been completed,\n         Steveslist looks up the seller's\n         webhook URL (if set).

We don’t only send webhooks when an item is purchased - we also send them when a user receives a message; when one of their items is removed by an admin; or when a buyer makes a complaint. This enables Steveslist sellers to automate not just the listing of items, but also the selling and shipping of them too.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"webhook-complications\">Webhook complications</h3>\n\n<p>Webhooks come with two main complications - security and reliability. First, let’s talk security. The endpoint to which the seller instructs us to send their webhooks is accessible to anyone on the internet. Anyone who knows the URL can send it fake webhooks, and if our seller isn’t careful this could allow an attacker to trick them into, for example, sending the attacker free stuff. A seller’s webhook URL should be difficult to find, since the seller won’t publicize its existence, but obscurity is not the same as security.</p>\n\n<p>To allow our sellers to verify that a webhook really was sent by Steveslist, we <em>cryptographically sign</em> our webhook contents.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"cryptographic-signing\">Cryptographic signing</h4>\n\n<p>Cryptographic signing is a deep and subtle topic. Here’s a condensed version of how we use it to secure our webhooks.</p>\n\n<p>When a seller enables webhooks for their account, we generate a random “shared secret key”. We tell the seller to copy this key over to their webhook-receiving server and keep it secure, so that its value is known only by us and the seller. Whenever we send a webhook, we take this shared secret, combine it with the contents of the webhook by using a <em>cryptographic hash function</em> called <em>HMAC</em>, and get back a long, random-seeming, but entirely deterministic “signature” for the webhook.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Webhook contents   +----------+\n(eg. {\"id\": 123...})          |\n                              v\n                          +---+----------+\n                          |HMAC Algorithm|-----&gt;Webhook signature\n                          +---+----------+\n                              ^\nShared secret key             |\n(eg. 123mhu23jy8xdwgmd...)+---+\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>We include this signature in our webhook body, for example:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-javascript highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">action</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">item_sold</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">// ...more params...</span>\n  <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">signature</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">234gj98d49j834978gf39t78ndn98g7dq3ng897308y7</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>When the seller’s webhook-receiving server receives a webhook, it takes the shared secret and webhook contents and calculates what it expects the signature to be in exactly the same way that we did. It compares the result to the signature attached to the webhook; if they match then it accepts and processes the webhook. Since the signature can only be generated using the shared secret known only by us and the seller, the webhook-receiving server can be confident that the webhook was sent by us. If the signatures don’t match, however, the server rejects the webhook.</p>\n\n<p>Note that all of the signature verification code must be written and maintained by the sellers. We can provide them with encouragement and examples, but we can’t force them to verify signatures correctly, or even at all. For some real-world examples, look at how <a href=\"https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/signatures\">Stripe</a> and <a href=\"https://developer.github.com/webhooks/securing/\">GitHub</a> sign their webhooks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"reliability\">Reliability</h3>\n\n<p>We also need to consider what happens when our webhooks go wrong and what guarantees we want to make to our users about them. If we try to send a webhook but can’t connect to the user’s server, what should we do? What if we successfully connect to their server and send the webhook, but their server sends back an error? What if we send the webhook but the server hangs for twenty seconds before disconnecting without telling us what happened?</p>\n\n<p>There are tradeoffs involved here that require clear communication and a surprising amount of infrastructure to manage. We at Steveslist choose to guarantee that we will deliver webhooks “at least once”. This means that if a webhook fails to send then we will keep trying (a large but not infinite number of times) until it does. If we’re not sure whether a webhook succeeded or failed, we will keep trying until we are sure that an attempt has succeeded. This might occasionally result in us sending the same webhook twice, but it’s the seller’s responsibility to have their code handle this gracefully instead of sending the same customer five stolen TVs instead of the one that they ordered.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>“What do you think so far?” asks Kate. “Is this roughly what you’ve been thinking?” You make a non-committal face and take a big bite of a nearby sandwich in order to preclude any further discussion. Kate continues:</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let’s talk about the backend systems that will power some of our most important features.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"user-authentication-via-a-password\">User authentication via a password</h2>\n\n<p>Most users sign into the Steveslist website and smartphone apps using a username and password. There are other ways of signing into the website, like <em>OAuth</em> - we’ll cover them another time.</p>\n\n<p>We will have to store our users’ passwords very securely. Not only is a user’s password the thing they use to sign in (or <em>authenticate</em>) to Stevelist, but for many users they’re probably the same password that they use to sign in to many other services too, despite all the warnings that this is a bad idea. They only have so many children with so many birthdays, after all.</p>\n\n<p>Rupert Herpton has written <a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2019/08/12/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners-user-logins/\">the seminal tutorial</a> on how to secure passwords, which I’m sure you’ve read already. Just in case you need a refresher, the crux of the matter is that we mustn’t ever store passwords in their original, <em>plaintext</em> form, anywhere. We mustn’t store them in plaintext in a database, in a log file, or in any other part of our system. Instead, before storing a password, we must first <em>hash</em> it using a <em>hash function</em> such as <em>bcrypt</em>.</p>\n\n<p>A hash function is a “one-way” function that takes an input and deterministically converts it into a new, seemingly-random string. Calculating a hash value from an input is computationally very easy, but reversing the transformation and recovering the original input from its hash value takes so much time and computing power that it is, practically-speaking, impossible.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>+---------+     Easy    +----------+\n|         |------------&gt;|          |\n|Plaintext|             |Hash value|\n|         |&lt;------------|          |\n+---------+ Essentially +----------+\n            Impossible\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Since we only store the hash values of our users’ passwords, if a hacker somehow stole our password database (heaven forbid) (touch wood) then they would only be able to see the passwords’ hash values. They wouldn’t be able to easily turn these hash values back into <em>plaintext</em> passwords, meaning that they wouldn’t be able to use them to login to Steveslist, and they won’t be able to take advantage of all the people who re-use passwords across different services.</p>\n\n<p>Since we only store password hash values, when we want to check whether a login password that a user has given us is correct we first calculate its hash value, and compare the result to the hash value in our password database.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>                 +--------------+\n                 |User's Browser|\n                 +-----------+--+\n1.User attempts to  |        ^\nlog in:             |        |  3.

This can be an easy mistake to make - if you log all of the parameters of every HTTP request, just in case you need it, you will certainly be logging user passwords. Facebook logged passwords in plaintext for many years, and whilst it didn’t seem to affect their stock price I’m sure it made them feel pretty silly for a day or two.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Kate pauses for breath. You pretend to take notes on your out-of-battery laptop.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Let’s talk about infrastructure.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"database-servers\">Database servers</h2>\n\n<p>Steveslist’s primary data store runs a common flavor of SQL database called <em>MySQL</em>. I won’t talk much about SQL here - the specifics of how it works aren’t too important, and you can find them on Google if you’re interested. Since we are so successful, we have a huge and growing amount of data to manage. We’ve started to become acutely aware that databases aren’t magic. They run on computers, just like any other program. As the volume of data in a database grows, the computer’s hard drive and memory starts to fill up. At the start of the company the easiest way to deal with this problem was to run our database on a single computer (or <em>machine</em>) with an enormous hard drive. But this could only stave off the problem for so long. Eventually our database contained more data than could be stored on any reasonable hard drive, and the database started to get slower and slower as we forced it to search through more and more records.</p>\n\n<p>We had to take an entirely new approach, and reconfigure our database to store its data on multiple computers. We did this using <em>sharding</em>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sharding\">Sharding</h3>\n\n<p>Sharding a database means splitting its data into chunks (or “shards”) and storing each chunk on a separate machine. All of the machines that make up a database are together known as a <em>database cluster</em>. How you split data between machine in your cluster depends on your application and the types of operations you will be performing. For Steveslist we chose to split out our data by user. This means that all of the data for a given user is stored on the same machine. This includes their profile information, their listings, their messages, and so on. Data that doesn’t have a corresponding user (like “Deals of the Day”) can be sharded using a <em>shard key</em> other than user, or not sharded at all if the dataset is sufficiently small.</p>\n\n<p>This means that we need an extra “routing” layer in front of our database, which knows which database machine is able to service which queries. We could either make our <em>application servers</em> (the servers that execute our code) responsible for knowing the mapping of user IDs to database shards, or have a centralized “router” that all servers send their requests to, and which is responsible for working out the appropriate machine to forward the request on to. Both approaches have their advantages. Making application servers responsible for maintaining the mapping reduces the number of hops that a request has to make, speeding them up. But having a centralized router makes updating the shard mapping much easier, since you only have to update it in one place.</p>\n\n<p>If application servers are responsible for knowing the shard layout, we have a system that looks like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>            +          +          +\n            |          |          |\n            | Requests from users |\n            |          |          |\n            v          v          v\n     +------+----------+--------------------+\n     |            Application               |\n     |               Server                 |\n     |                                      |\n     |Database sharding config:             |\n     |* DB Server 1: IDs between 1-10000    |\n     |* DB Server 2: IDs between 10000-20000|\n     |* DB Server 3: IDs between 20000-30000|\n     +-+----------------+-----------------+-+\n       |                |                 |\n       |ID:501          |ID:15362         |ID:22361\n       |                |                 |\n       v                v                 v\n+-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+\n|DB Server 1|     |DB Server 2|     |DB Server 3|\n+-----------+     +-----------+     +-----------+\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If we have a centralized database router, we have a system that looks like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>            +          +          +\n            |          |          |\n            | Requests from users |\n            |          |          |\n            v          v          v\n     +------+----------+--------------------+\n     |            Application               |\n     |               Server                 |\n     |                                      |\n     |Database sharding config:             |\n     |* ???

However we want. We could start by saying that users with odd-numbered IDs are assigned to shard machine 1, and those with even-numbered ones are assigned to shard machine 2. We could hope that this random assignment results in balancing our data relatively evenly between our shards.</p>\n\n<p>However, it’s possible that we might have a small number of power users who create much, much more data than others. Maybe they create so much data that we want to allocate them a shard of their own. This is completely fine - we have complete control over how users are assigned to shards. Random assignments are usually easiest, but are by no means the only option. We can choose to assign users to shards randomly - except for user 367823, who is assigned to shard 15, which no other user is assigned to.</p>\n\n<p>If a shard gets too big and starts to fill up its machine’s hard-drive, we can split it up into multiple, smaller shards. How do we migrate the data to these new shards without having to turn off our platform for a while? Probably using a sequential process like:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>“Double-write” new data to both the old and new shards. Continue reading data from the old shard</li>\n  <li>Copy over all existing data from the old shard to the new shard. Continue double-writing to old and new shards</li>\n  <li>Convince ourselves that the old and new shards contain the same data. We could do this by comparing snapshots of the databases, and/or by reading every query from both databases, comparing them, and alerting if the data is different</li>\n  <li>Once we’re confident that the new and old shards contain the same data, we switch to reading from the new shards. We continue double-writing in case we need to switch back</li>\n  <li>Once we’re confident that this step has been successful, stop double-writing and delete the old shard</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Rupert Herpton has written <a href=\"https://robertheaton.com/2015/08/31/migrating-bajillions-of-database-records-at-stripe/\">a great article about a broadly-similar type of migration</a> that goes into much more detail. In short, the process of migrating data between database shards is detailed and finicky, but also entirely doable and logical. Some types of database can even automatically take care of sharding for you.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"replication\">Replication</h3>\n\n<p>We will take great care to make sure that our data doesn’t get accidentally deleted and our database servers don’t randomly stop working. But accidents happen, and sometimes computers do randomly stop working. To mitigate the fallout of a database-related disaster, we <em>replicate</em> our data across multiple machines in (close to) realtime.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>       Client writes new\n       data to DB Server A\n                |\n                v\n          +-----+-----+\n          |DB Server A|\n          ++---------++\n           |         | DB Server A quickly replicates\n           v         v the new data to DB Servers B and C\n+----------++      +-+---------+\n|DB Server B|      |DB Server C|\n+-----------+      +-----------+\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Realtime replication has two main benefits. First, it means that if one of our database servers explodes, catches fire, or otherwise stops working, we have multiple almost-perfect copies of it that can seamlessly pick up the slack. In a straightforward, vanilla failure, users of our services may never know that anything has gone wrong. The second benefit of replication is that we can distribute queries for the same data across multiple database servers. If lots of users are asking to read data from the same database, we can split their queries up across all of our copies, meaning that we can handle more queries in parallel.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>  Clients can query the same data\n  from any of DB Servers A,B,or C\n    |  |    |   |   |    |  |\n    |  |    v   v   v    |  |\n    |  |  +-+---+---+-+  |  |\n    |  |  |DB Server A|  |  |\n    |  |  +-----------+  |  |\n    |  |                 |  |\n    v  v                 v  v\n+---+-------+      +-----+-+---+\n|DB Server B|      |DB Server C|\n+-----------+      +-----------+\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Note that database replication is not the same concept as making database backups. Replication happens in (close to) realtime, and is designed to deal on-the-fly with isolated problems in your live (or <em>production</em>) systems. Database backups are performed on a schedule (for example, once a day), and the copies of the data are stored separately, away from production systems. Backups are designed as a final safeguard against widespread, catastrophic data loss, as might happen if all your data centers burned down.</p>\n\n<p>Pretend that you work in the call centre of a big bank, where people are constantly calling you up in order to send money transfers and ask about their current balance. Replication is the equivalent of hurriedly writing down transfer details into multiple books, as you receive them, just in case you lose one of the books. Making backups is the equivalent of photocopying those books once a day and storing the copies in your filing cabinet.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"replication-1\">Replication</h3>\n\n<p>The process of replication is conceptually quite straightforward. Whenever new data is written to our database, we copy it to multiple machines. This means that if/when a machine fails we can continue querying its siblings, with no user-facing impact. It also means that we can spread our queries out across multiple copies of the same data, resulting in faster query response times.</p>\n\n<p>However, the details of how we do this are important, subtle, and situation-dependent. There’s no right way to do replication - as is so often the case, the exact approach that you take depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your system.</p>\n\n<p>Replication is complicated by two inconvenient facts about the real world. First, database operations randomly fail sometimes. When we attempt to replicate our data from one server to another, things <em>will</em> occasionally go wrong, causing our machines to become out of sync, at least for a period. Second, even in periods of smooth operation, replication is not instantaneous. When new data is written to our database cluster, some servers in the cluster will always know about the update sooner than others. When choosing a replication strategy we must be aware of these limitations and how they impact our particular application. For example, maybe it’s OK to risk the number of “likes” on a post being slightly out of sync and out of date, but not the amount of money in a user’s bank account.</p>\n\n<p>One of the biggest decisions we must make when choosing a replication strategy is whether we want our replication to be <em>synchronous</em> or <em>asynchronous</em>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"asynchronous-vs-synchronous-replication\">Asynchronous vs synchronous replication</h3>\n\n<p>Replication can be handled either synchronously or asynchronously. These words come up in a lot of different places in systems design, but they always fundamentally mean the same thing. If an action is performed “synchronously” then this means that it is performed while something waits for it. If you wanted to send a letter synchronously then you would got to the Post Office, give your letter to a postal worker, sit and wait in the corner of the Post Office for a few days, and only go home when the postal worker confirmed that your letter had arrived safely.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, if an action is performed “asynchronously” then this means that the initiator of the action doesn’t wait around for it to be finished. Instead, they just continue with the rest of their work while the action is worked on in the background. The real Postal Service is asynchronous; you give your letter to a postal worker, then leave and continue with your life while the Postal Service delivers your letter. Asynchronous actions can send back notifications of the outcome of the action if they want (“Your letter has arrived and was signed for” or “Mr. Heaton, your dry-cleaning is ready”), but they don’t have to.</p>\n\n<p>How do these principles apply to database replication? In synchronous replication a client writes its new data to a database server and then waits. This server doesn’t tell the client whether their write has been completed successfully until it has finished fully replicating the client’s data across all of its sibling servers. Then, and only then, does the client continue executing the rest of its code.</p>\n\n<p>In asynchronous replication the client writes its data to the first database server, as before. But this time the first server tells the client that the write was successful as soon as it has written the data to its own data store. It kicks off the replication process in the background, and doesn’t wait for it to complete, or even start, before it tells the client that the write was successful. This means that the asynchronous operation appears much faster than the synchronous one, because the client doesn’t have to wait for all the replication to complete before it can continue on with the rest of its work. However, if the background replication fails then the client will believe that it has successfully written its data to the database when it actually has not. This could cause problems, the imagination of which is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>\n\n<p>The synchronous approach is slower but “safer” than an asynchronous approach. The database never claims to have successfully received and stored any data until it has finished every single step of doing so. Because the client waits for full confirmation before proceeding, it is guaranteed to never encounter a situation where the client believes that it has written some data to the database, but the database has secretly partially dropped the data on the floor.</p>\n\n<p>Which approach is better? It depends. Do you care more about speed or correctness? Is it OK to occasionally have inconsistent data if it significantly speeds up the system’s operation? Or will even a single mistake cause airplanes to start falling out of the sky?</p>\n\n<p>Database replication systems face other interesting problems too. Many of these problems are “logical” rather than “technical”, and don’t require a detailed understanding of the complex software and networking protocols underlying the system. To help picture some of them, imagine that you’re back in the call centre from a few paragraphs ago. You work with many other colleagues. Together you play the role of database servers. People call you up to transfer money and ask about their current balance. You and your colleagues write information about new transfers down on paper, and replicate it between yourselves by calling each other up.</p>\n\n<p>The problems faced by our database cluster are identical to those faced by our call-centre. What happens if two people call in and try to update the same piece of data at the same time by talking to two different employees? Maybe we solve that by having a “leader” employee who is the only one authorized to serve calls from people trying to create transfers. All the other employees are only allowed to answer queries about current balances. OK, so what happens if the leader has a stroke and dies after they’ve received some new data, but before they’ve told everyone else about it? What if a “follower” employee has a temporary seizure for a few seconds and misses some data updates from the leader? What if we’re never entirely sure which of our employees are dead or alive?</p>\n\n<p>This is not an approximate metaphor that breaks down if you look too hard or start asking awkward questions. Understand this weird call-centre and you understand database replication. <a href=\"https://www.brianstorti.com/replication/\">Read this blog post</a> and you <em>really</em> understand replication.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"backups\">Backups</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to realtime replication, we also store regular backups of our entire database in order to protect against catastrophic disaster. We copy all of the data in our database, store it somewhere safe, and mark it as something like “database backup, 2020-05-11:01:00”.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>+----------+  \n| Database +----------------&gt; database backup, 2020-05-11:01:00\n+----------+                  database backup, 2020-05-10:01:00\n                              database backup, 2020-05-09:01:00\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>If our entire database - or some fraction of it - somehow gets wiped out, we grab the most recent backup available and load it into new database machines.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>+----------+\n|   New    |\n| Database +&lt;---------------- database backup, 2020-05-11:01:00\n+----------+                  database backup, 2020-05-10:01:00\n                              database backup, 2020-05-09:01:00\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Such a calamity could be caused by a cyberattack, a disaster in our data centre, a database migration gone horribly wrong, or any number of unlikely but potentially company-destroying reasons. Unlike realtime replication, restoring a database from a backup is a slow process that our users will definitely notice. Our entire system will likely be offline until the restoration is complete. We will have lost all database updates that occurred after the last backup but before the disaster. And there will no doubt be a large number of knock-on effects as users and systems try to access data that used to be there but is now lost forever. Nonetheless, these are all much less terrible than the complete, irrevocable loss of all our company’s data and with it, our company.</p>\n\n<p>That’s a whole lot of detail about our primary SQL database. Let’s talk about some other ways in which we store and query data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"free-text-searching\">Free-text searching</h2>\n\n<p>A standard SQL database is very good at answering well-defined and specific queries. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Give me all the item listings created by user #145122 in the last 90 days</li>\n  <li>Give me the listing details for item #237326921</li>\n  <li>Give me the count of new listings per day created in San Francisco with the label “Electronics”</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can retrieve this kind of data using SQL queries that look something like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-sql highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">user_id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">145122</span> <span class=\"k\">AND</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">created</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">currentDate</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">90</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>or</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-sql highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">DATE_TRUNC</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'day'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">created</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">AS</span> <span class=\"k\">day</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">COUNT</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span> <span class=\"k\">AS</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span>\n<span class=\"k\">INNER</span> <span class=\"k\">JOIN</span> <span class=\"n\">labels</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span>\n  <span class=\"k\">ON</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">item_id</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">city</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'San Francisco'</span> <span class=\"k\">AND</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'electronics'</span>\n<span class=\"k\">GROUP</span> <span class=\"k\">BY</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n<span class=\"k\">ORDER</span> <span class=\"k\">BY</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"k\">DESC</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>You’ll notice that these queries contain a lot of very “precise” operators, like equals- and greater-than-signs. But how would you write a SQL query that could return a list of items that match a Google-style “full-text” search, like “second-hand TV”?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/images/systems-design-search.png\"></p>\n\n<p>This would be difficult. You could try the SQL <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">LIKE</code> operator, which allows you to find records containing a pattern, such as a sub-string. For example, the following query finds all items with a description containing the sub-string <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">second-hand TV</code>:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-sql highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"k\">LIKE</span> <span class=\"s1\">'%second-hand TV%'</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>However, this query will only match the very specific sub-string that it was given. It won’t match “TV that is second-hand” or “2nd-hand TV”, or “sceond-hnad TV”. Given enough perseverance you could theoretically construct a giant SQL-query that covered as many of these permutations as you had patience for:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-sql highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"k\">LIKE</span> <span class=\"s1\">'%second%hand%TV'</span> <span class=\"k\">OR</span>\n  <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"k\">LIKE</span> <span class=\"s1\">'%second%TV%hand'</span> <span class=\"k\">OR</span>\n  <span class=\"c1\">-- …and so on and so on for another bajillion ORs…</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>However, the resulting query would be slow and cumbersome, and would still miss many important edge-cases that you hadn’t thought of. And even if you did get back a useful list of search results, you’d still have a lot of work left to do in order to decide how to order them. The ordering you want isn’t something strict like “most-recent first” or “alphabetically by title”. Instead it’s some much woolier notion of “best” or “most-relevant” first.</p>\n\n<p>All of this means that SQL databases are generally not very good at full-text searches. Fortunately, other types of database are, including one called <em>Elasticsearch</em>. Elasticsearch is often described as a <em>document-oriented database</em>. We don’t need to go into the details of how exactly it works, but the important part for us is that, unlike SQL databases, Elasticsearch is very good at taking queries like “second-hand TV” and returning a list, ordered by “relevance,” of the fuzzy matches that users have come to expect from their search engines.</p>\n\n<p>“Sounds like Elasticsearch is just better than SQL,” you might say. “Should we throw away our SQL databases and put everything in Elasticsearch instead?” Not so fast. Elasticsearch, and other databases like it, have their strengths, but they also have their weaknesses. They’re typically somewhat less reliable than SQL databases, and are somewhat more likely to accidentally lose data at large scale. They’re also often much slower to write new data to.</p>\n\n<p>As we’ve already noted, there’s rarely a single, universally “best” tool for any type of job. There’s certainly no such thing as “the best” database. Instead, different databases have different strengths and weaknesses, and different solutions are appropriate for different tasks. At Steveslist, we care so much about making sure that we use the right tool for the right job that we store our data in both a SQL database <em>and</em> a document-oriented database like Elasticsearch.</p>\n\n<p>We use our SQL database as our primary data store. It is our authoritative “source-of-truth”, and we write all our new data to it before we write it anywhere else. We do all our simple, precise reads from it, especially when accuracy and up-to-date-ness are our principal requirements. If we want to show a user a list of all their open listings, we read it from our SQL database. If we want to validate a users password, we read that from our SQL database too. This plays to the strengths of SQL databases.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the background we also copy data from our SQL database into an Elasticsearch database, and send any full-text search queries made via our search box to Elasticsearch. This means that we benefit from the strengths of Elasticsearch, and are not impacted too much by its weaknesses. We copy over batches of records every few minutes, hours, or days, depending on the requirements of the specific dataset. Alternatively, we could watch the logs of our SQL database for new or updated records, and create or update the corresponding Elasticsearch records in near-realtime.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>                   |      |                   |\nNew data is always |      |Queries for        |Full-text search \nwritten to the SQL |      |specific data go   |queries go to\nDB first           |      |to the SQL DB too  |Elasticsearch\n                   V      V                   V\n               +--------------+       +---------------+\n               | SQL Database +------&gt;+ Elasticsearch |\n               +--------------+       +---------------+\n                       New data is copied over from\n                       the SQL DB to Elasticsearch\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>When scouting Steveslist’s competition, I noticed that when you create a new Craigslist listing it says “your listing will be visible in search within the next 15 minutes”. I’ll bet pesos to pizza that this is because their primary datastore is a SQL database, but their search box is powered by an Elasticsearch-like engine. Their pipeline for replicating data from SQL to search probably takes around 15 minutes, which they’ve decided (very reasonably) is an acceptable delay for their particular use-case.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve said that Elasticsearch is somewhat less reliable than most SQL databases. If Elasticsearch accidentally loses a few of our records then they won’t appear in search results. This would be a shame that would make our product a bit worse, and we try our hardest to avoid it happening. However, it wouldn’t be a disaster in the same way that losing data from our primary data store would be. We only copy data over to Elasticsearch once it has been written to and safely captured by our source-of-truth SQL database, which is what really matters.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It’s 6pm, and the library is closing. A librarian tries to ask you to leave. Kate shoos him away with a barrage of crumpled-up balls of paper.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2 id=\"internal-tools\">Internal tools</h2>\n\n<p>Managing the Steveslist platform requires bespoke internal tools. We need to perform a wide range of administrative tasks, like deleting listings that are too illegal (even for us), issuing refunds, viewing a user’s personal details in order to help with support requests, and so on. Many of these tools will be used by people who work on other teams at Steveslist, like finance, compliance, legal, sales, and support. Since the tasks they need to perform are so specific to the way that Steveslist works, we can’t do them using third-party tools, and have to build our own instead.</p>\n\n<p>In the early days, we baked this functionality into the main Stevelist product and only exposed it to users who had the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">is_steveslist_employee = True</code> database flag set. This was an OK approach for a small company, but was also fragile and easy to mess up. It was scary to think that we were exposing all of our superuser powers through the same servers that run our main product. It made the potential consequences of a security flaw in our application much worse, and created new types of mistake for us to make, such as forgetting to disable the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">is_steveslist_employee</code> flag for an acrimoniously fired employee.</p>\n\n<p>Once Steveslist reached a certain level of maturity, we built ourselves an entirely separate admin platform, with separate, hardened authentication and authorization. The service runs on entirely separate servers, and requires a <em>VPN</em> and a <em>TLS client certificate</em> to access (which we’ll talk about another day). This separated out our internal- and external-facing products, and drastically reduced the chance of a boneheaded error exposing our admin tools to the world. We’re frequently building new internal tools - one for user administration, one for server management, one for fraud detection, and so on. These services all talk to the same database as our user-facing products, so they all have access to the same data. They just run on different servers that are completely inaccessible to the outside world.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"cron-jobs\">Cron jobs</h2>\n\n<p>There are lots of tasks that we’ll want our system to perform at fixed times and intervals. For example:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Emailing ourselves weekly usage reports</li>\n  <li>Sending marketing emails to users</li>\n  <li>Charging the credit cards users who have a subscription plan with us</li>\n  <li>Copying data from our SQL database to Elasticsearch</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The most common tool used for running scheduled jobs is called <em>cron</em>, a tool that is built into Unix operating systems. It’s so common that people will often call any kind of scheduled job a “cron job”, even when it’s not actually being run by cron.</p>\n\n<p>You can set up a cron job on your own computer by running:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>crontab -e\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>Then typing into the prompt:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>*/5 * * * * $YOUR_COMMAND\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>This will cause your computer to execute <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">$YOUR_COMMAND</code> every 5 minutes.</p>\n\n<p>Steveslist currently has a very simple and slightly fragile cron setup. We have a single “scheduled jobs server”. We use <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">crontab</code> on this server (as above) to tell it the commands that we want it to run, and the schedule that we want it to run them on. This setup isn’t scaling very well - if the scheduled jobs server explodes or even hiccups then we don’t always know which jobs it did and didn’t run, and have to scramble to bring up a replacement server. And even though the server is very beefy and powerful, eventually we’re going to want to run more jobs than it can handle at once. We’re considering either splitting up our cron jobs into multiple servers, or setting up a new system using a modern tool like <em>Kubernetes</em>.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"pubsub\">Pubsub</h2>\n\n<p>Actions have consequences. This is both the subject line of the sinister emails that we send to people who write mean things about us on the internet, and the reason we have a <em>pubsub</em> system.</p>\n\n<p>When a new user signs up, we want to send them an email welcoming them to Steveslist and reminding them about the action-consequence relationship I just described. When a new listing is added for a stolen TV in San Francisco, we want to notify users who have set up search alerts for TVs in the Bay Area. When a card is declined for a subscription, we want to email the responsible user to politely threaten them. When a new listing is added, we want to perform some extremely cursory anti-fraud checks. When an item is purchased, we want to sent a webhook to its seller. And so on.</p>\n\n<p>Technically, all of these actions could be performed synchronously (rememberer that word?) by the server executing the initiating action. However, this is often a bad idea, for two reasons. First, the response action (such as emailing all the users who are subscribed for notifications about new stolen TVs) may be very slow. Performing the response action synchronously means that if the initiating action was performed by a user then they will have to wait for all the response actions to finish too. This might not be the end of the world if the response action is small and quick, like sending a single email. But if it’s larger - like searching for and notifying all users who might be interested in a new item - then, well, it still won’t be the end of the world, but it will be a bad user experience.</p>\n\n<p>To mitigate this problem we have built a “publish-subscribe” or “pubsub” system. When a trigger action is performed, the code that performs it “publishes an event” describing the action, such as <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">NewListingCreated</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">SubscriptionCardDeclined</code>. The words “event” and “publish” are quite loosely defined in this context, and don’t have a rigorous technical definition. An event is just some sort of record of something that happened, and to publish an event just means that you somehow make a note that something happened. The details of how you do so depend entirely on the pubsub system in question. In a simple system events might be stored in tables in a SQL database, and code would publish events by writing new records to a table.</p>\n\n<p>If a programmer at Steveslist wants a response action to be performed whenever a new event of a particular type is published, they can write a <em>consumer</em>. This is a piece of code that “subscribes” to a type of event, and which is executed whenever a new event of that type is published. It uses the details of the event (for example, the user whose subscription payment failed) to asynchronously execute whatever actions the programmer wants (for example, sending the user a menacing email).</p>\n\n<p>Pubsub systems are often managed by a central <em>message broker</em>. Systems publish events to the broker, and the broker is then responsible for getting the events to any subscribed consumers. This can be achieved using either a <em>push</em> or a <em>pull</em> mechanism. Consumers can pull messages from the broker by polling it and repeatedly asking “any new events? any new events?” or they can wait and listen and the broker can push notifications of new events out to them, for example by sending them an HTTP request.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>1.

The code that publishes an event doesn’t have to care about what the events’ subscribers do in response</li>\n  <li>If a subscriber’s action fails for some reason (for example, the email-sending system has a hiccup), the pubsub system can note this failure and retry again later</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Next, let’s talk big data.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"big-data-and-analytics\">Big data and analytics</h2>\n\n<p>In order to understand and optimize our business, we need to be able to calculate complex statistics across the entire Steveslist platform. How many listings are created every day, segmented by country and city? How many users who signed up each month have created a listing within 90 days of signing up?</p>\n\n<p>To do this, we need to write database queries that aggregate over the entirety of our data. We don’t want to run these queries against our production SQL database, because they could put an enormous amount of load on it. We don’t want a huge query issued by an internal analyst to be able to bring our production database to a grinding halt, but we do want to provide this analyst with a tool that is well-suited to their needs. To complicate matters further, database engines that are quick at small queries (like returning all the listings belonging to a single user) are typically unacceptably slow (or indeed incapable) of answering giant queries (like calculating the total dollars spent on listings in each category, per day, for the last 90 days).</p>\n\n<p>Despite this, for the first year or so after Steveslist was founded, we took a risk and simply ran our analytics queries against the main production database. This was a gamble, but it just about worked. We didn’t have much data anyway, and we had more important things to focus on, like attracting the customers who would create the big data that would one day mean that we had to find a more scalable solution.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually we did bring down the production database with an overly-ambitious query, and decided that the time had come to invest in a data warehouse. A data warehouse is a data store that is well-suited to large, system-wide queries. Our warehouse is powered by a database engine called <em>Hive</em>, but we could also have chosen Presto, Impala, Redshift, or any number of competing alternatives. Hive accepts queries written in SQL, but is much better at executing these queries against giant datasets than our MySQL database is.</p>\n\n<p>We replicate our data from our production SQL database to Hive, once a day, overnight. Steveslist analysts and programmers can query the same dataset using whichever database engine best suits their needs. They can use the production SQL database for small, precise, source-of-truth queries from production systems; Elasticsearch for full-text search queries; or the data warehouse for huge queries that aggregate over vast volumes of data.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It’s dark outside and you’re hungry. Is that pretty much it? you ask.</p>\n\n<p>“Oh god no,” Kate replies, “we could keep going forever. But this is a pretty good start. It’s helpful to have a broad understanding of a wide range of topics, but no one needs to know the details about everything. I find that once you know some basics you can keep picking up more basics and even a couple of details as you go along.”</p>\n\n<p>You ask if Kate could perhaps continue to elaborate on her five-year vision for Steveslist tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>“Absolutely,” says Kate.

One-track lover / Down a two-way lane\nAbout\nArchive\nTwitter\nNEW: Programming Feedback for Advanced Beginners\nSystems design for advanced beginners\n06 Apr 2020\nThis post is part of my Programming for Advanced Beginners series. Subscribe now to receive specific, actionable ways to make your code cleaner, every other week, entirely free.\nYou’ve started yet another company with your good friend, Steve Steveington. It’s an online marketplace where people can buy and sell things and where no one asks too many questions. It’s basically a rip-off of Craigslist, but with Steve’s name instead of Craig’s.\nYou’re going to be responsible for building the entire Steveslist technical platform, including all of its websites, mobile apps, databases, and other infrastructure. You’re excited, but also very nervous. You figure that you can probably cobble together a small website, since you’ve done that a few times before as part of your previous entertaining-if-morally-questionable escapades with the Stevester. But you have no idea how to even start building out all of the other infrastructure and tools that you assume lie behind large, successful online platforms.\nYou are in desperate need of a detailed yet concise overview of how real companies do this. How do they store their data? How do their different applications talk to each other? How do they scale their systems to work for millions of users? How do they keep them secure? How do they make sure nothing goes wrong? What are APIs, webhooks and client libraries, when you really get down to it?\nYou send a quick WhatsApp to your other good friend, Kate Kateberry, to see if she can help. You’ve worked together very effectively in the past, and she has decades of experience creating these types of systems at Silicon Valley’s biggest and most controversial companies.\nShe instantly accepts your job offer. You had actually only been ringing for some rough guidance and a good gossip, but you nonetheless instantly accept her acceptance. No point looking a gift horse in the mouth, even when you don’t have any money to pay her. Kate proposes that her first day be 5 weeks ago in order to help her smooth over some accounting irregularities. She can come into the office sometime next week. You feel encouraged and threatened by her eagerness.\nKate bounces into your offices in the 19th Century Literature section of the San Francisco Public Library. “OK let’s do this!” she shouts quietly. “What have we got so far? How are all our systems set up? What’s the plan?” You lean back in your chair and close your laptop, which was not turned on because you have left your charger at home. You steeple your fingers in a manner that you hope can be described as “thoughtful”.\n“Let me flip that question around, Kate. What do you think the plan should be?”\nKate takes a deep breath and paints an extremely detailed vision of the Steveslist platform five years into the future and the infrastructure that will power it.\nBefore we start (says Kate), I want to make it clear that I’m not saying that any of this is necessarily the “right” way to set up our infrastructure. If someone you trust more than me says something different then you should probably do what they say. There are many tools out there, each with different strengths and weaknesses, and many ways to build a technology company. The real, honest reasons that we will make many of our technological choices will be “we chose X because Sara knows a lot about X” and “we chose Y on the spur of the moment when it didn’t seem like a big decision and we never found the time to re-evaluate.”\nNonetheless, let’s fast-forward five years into the future. Now Steveslist has two main consumer-facing products:\nThe Steveslist web app\nThe Steveslist smartphone apps\nThese are the main ways in which users directly interact with the Steveslist platform. In addition, we also provide an API that allows programmers to build power-tools on top of the Steveslist platform that, for example, create listings for hundreds of items programmatically. To support this, we offer:\nA Steveslist API\nSteveslist API client libraries that make it easy for programmers to write code that talks to our API\nHere, I’ll draw a diagram on the whiteboard:\n<code>+-----------+ +--------------+ +-----------------+\n|Web Browser| |Smartphone App| |Client Libraries/|\n+-----+-----+ +------+-------+ |Other API code | | | +-------+---------+ | v | | +-----+------+ | +---------&gt;+ Steveslist +&lt;-----------+ | Servers | +------------+\n</code>\nFinally, we have many, many services running in the background that provide the data and power to these external-facing applications:\nWebhooks - to notify users when something happens to their account, such as “order placed”\nUser password authentication - to securely log users in\nSQL database - the main Steveslist data store. Needs to be highly scalable and reliable\nFree-text searching system - to power the search box where people can look for broad search terms like “TVs” or “motorbikes”\nInternal tools - to help us administer the Steveslist platform, and to take actions like issuing sternly-worded warnings to malicious users\nCron jobs - to run regular tasks that do anything from generating invoices, to billing customers, to sending as much of our users’ data as possible to third-party ad networks\n“Pubsub” system - to allow us to take asynchronous actions on different trigger events (such as “when a new user signs up, send them a welcome email”)\nBig data analytics system - to allow us to run enormous queries over the entirety of Steveslist’s data\nAnd many more that we’ll talk about another day\nLet’s go through each of these systems in turn. Let me know if anything isn’t clear, if you have any questions, or if you think I’ve got something wrong.\nBefore we start - what is a server really?\nBefore we start, let’s define some important terms. In fact, let’s just define one. We’re going to talk a lot about “servers” today. But what is a server, when you really get down to it?\nFor our purposes, a server is a computer that runs on a network and listens for communications from other computers. When it receives some data from another computer it performs some sort of action in response and - usually - sends back some data of its own. For example, a web server listens on a network for HTTP requests and sends back webpages and information in response. A database server listens for database queries and reads and writes data to the database that it is running.\nThis brief description skips out entire degrees and careers of detail, and there are of course far more precise and accurate ways to define the word “server”. But this should get us through until dinnertime. What did you say? What’s a “network” really? A good question for another day.\nNow we’re ready to talk about the Steveslist platform.\nSteveslist web app\nThis is the main Steveslist product. It’s just a normal web app, very similar to any website that you’ve built before, except much bigger. It’s a modern “single-page app” (SPA). The “single” in “single-page app” refers to the fact that the user’s browser almost never has to fully reload the page as the user clicks around our site. Instead, when the browser makes its first HTTP request to our servers, we send it back a basic, skeleton HTML page and a big pile of JavaScript code. This JavaScript code executes inside the browser, and updates the view of the page in response to the user’s actions. When the JavaScript wants to send or retrieve data from Steveslist, it sends an Asynchronous JavaScript XML Request (almost always called AJAX for short) in the background to a URL. When our server responds, the JavaScript uses the response to update the browser view accordingly.\n<code>+----------+1.User's browser visits steveslist.com. +----------+\n| | It sends an HTTP request to the | |\n| | Steveslist servers | |\n| +---------------------------------------&gt;| |\n|User's Web| |Steveslist|\n| Browser |2.Steveslist server responds with a | Servers |\n| | skeleton HTML page that instructs the | |\n| | browser to request additional | |\n| | JavaScript files. | |\n| |&lt;---------------------------------------+ |\n| | | |\n| |3.User's browser requests and receives | |\n| | these JavaScript files from the | |\n| | Steveslist server. | |\n| +---------------------------------------&gt;| |\n| |&lt;---------------------------------------+ |\n| | | |\n| |4.User's browser executes the JavaScript| |\n| | code. The code sends more requests for| |\n| | the user's data to the Stevelist | |\n| | server, and updates the browser UI to | |\n| | display it. | |\n| +---------------------------------------&gt;| |\n| |&lt;---------------------------------------+ |\n+----------+ +----------+\n</code>\nrobertheaton.com is not a single-page app. Whenever you click on a link, the browser has to reload the entire page. twitter.com is a single-page app. Whenever you click on a link, the browser dynamically updates a small portion of tthe page without forcing a full refresh.\nSPAs are a lot of work to build and maintain, but they sure look good.\nSteveslist smartphone apps\nWe provide Steveslist smartphone apps for both iOS and Android. They are conceptually very similar to our single-page web app. Both our smartphone and web apps make HTTP requests to our servers. Then our servers receive these requests, do some work and return an HTTP response. Finally, both our smartphone and web apps update their display in order to communicate with the user.\nSince our smartphone apps are performing the same operations as the web app (for example, create listing, send message, etc), they can usually even send their requests to the exact same URLs as the web app. The only extra work that we have to do is to develop the frontends of the apps themselves. Some frameworks even make it possible to write mobile apps using JavaScript, allowing you to reuse code and logic across platforms.\nSteveslist API\nWe allow users and third-parties to write code that programmatically interacts with our platform. In the same way that people can use the Twitter API to write code that reads; likes; and creates Tweets, we allow them to use the Steveslist API to search; buy; and list items.\nProgrammers use our API by writing code that makes HTTP requests to our API endpoints. For example, in order to retrieve a list of all their listings, the programmer sends an HTTP GET request to api.steveslist.com/v1/listings. We respond with the data they requested, formatted as JSON. JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation, but JSON is not specific to JavaScript and can easily be interpreted by any programming language. A JSON response to a request to retrieve all of a user’s listings might look something like this:\n<code><span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">listings</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"p\">[</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">id</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">2178123867</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">name</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">Stolen TV</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">country</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">US</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">city</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">San Francisco</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_amount</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_currency</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">usd</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"err\">#</span> <span class=\"nx\">etc</span><span class=\"p\">...</span> <span class=\"p\">},</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">id</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">182312679</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">name</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">Stolen Bicycle</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">country</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">US</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">city</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">San Francisco</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_amount</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">2000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price_currency</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">usd</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"err\">#</span> <span class=\"nx\">etc</span><span class=\"p\">...</span> <span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"p\">]</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code>\nThis structured response format is very easy for a program to parse, which means that the code that made the request can trivially interpret and use the data from our API.\nUsers identify or authenticate themselves to our API using an API key. This is, roughly speaking, the API equivalent of a password. It is a long, random string that we generate and display on a user’s “Settings” page. Users include their API key as an HTTP header with every HTTP request that they (or their code) makes to the API. When we receive an API request we check to see whether the attached API key corresponds to a Steveslist user. If it does then we perform the request on behalf of that user.\nIf a programmer wants to, they can manually build HTTP requests to our API themselves, using their language’s standard HTTP library. For example, in Python they might write:\n<code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">requests</span> <span class=\"n\">url</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">'https://api.steveslist.com/v1/listings/'</span>\n<span class=\"n\">listing_params</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"s\">\"name\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"Stolen TV\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"country\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"US\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"city\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"San Francisco\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"price_amount\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"s\">\"price_currency\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"s\">\"usd\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"n\">api_key</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s\">\"YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE\"</span> <span class=\"n\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">requests</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">post</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"n\">url</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">listing_params</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">headers</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"p\">{</span><span class=\"s\">\"X-Steveslist-API-Key\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"n\">api_key</span><span class=\"p\">},</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code>\nHowever, we make life easier for programmers by providing client libraries.\nSteveslist client libraries\nA client library is a library that “wraps” the functionality of the Steveslist API. This means that anyone using the client library doesn’t need to know anything about the fine details of the Steveslist API. Instead, they can just write:\n<code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">steveslist</span> <span class=\"n\">listing</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">steveslist</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Listing</span><span class=\"o\">.</span><span class=\"n\">create</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"n\">name</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"Stolen TV\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">country</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"US\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">city</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"San Francisco\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">price_amount</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">price_currency</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"usd\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">api_key</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s\">\"YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</code>\nOur libraries turn the parameters that they are given into appropriately formatted HTTP requests, which they send to the Steveslist API as normal. We’ve written client libraries for every major programming language that we could think of, and they are by far the most common way that people interact with our API.\nWebhooks\nWe’ve seen how Steveslist users can use our API to programmatically interact with their account. In addition, many users also want us to proactively tell them whenever something happens to their Steveslist profile. For example, suppose that someone wanted to fully automate the process of selling items on Steveslist. Whenever a customer pays for an item using our new, mostly-secure StevePay system, they want to send the customer a thank you email and automatically instruct their warehouse to ship a stolen TV to the order address. Our seller could constantly and repeatedly query the Steveslist API asking “Any new sales? Any new sales?” However, this would be very inefficient, and would put a lot of unnecessary load on our servers.\nInstead, we provide an industry standard system called webhooks. A webhook is an HTTP request that we send to our users whenever something interesting happens to their account. It contains all the data describing the event that just happened - for example, the item ID, the price, the buyer ID, buyer address, and so on. Webhooks allow users to automatically perform response actions, such as the aforementioned email and auto-shipping.\nTo use webhooks, the user tells us the URL to which they would like us to send their webhooks (for example, steveslistwebhooks.robertheaton.com. They set up a web server at that URL that will receive and action these webhook notifications.\n<code>1.Buyer purchases an 3.The seller's server receives the webhook, item as normal. and uses the information in it to automatically process the order.\n+---------------+ +-----------------+\n|Buyer's Browser| |Seller's Webhook-+\n+------+--------+ |Receiving Server | | +------+----------+ | ^ | | | | | +-----------+ | +---&gt;+ Steveslist+----------+ | Server | +-----------+ 2.Once the transaction has been completed, Steveslist looks up the seller's webhook URL (if set). We then send an HTTP request to this URL, containing the details of the purchase.\n</code>\nThe user deploys code on their web server that performs the appropriate response actions whenever it receives a webhook from us. We don’t only send webhooks when an item is purchased - we also send them when a user receives a message; when one of their items is removed by an admin; or when a buyer makes a complaint. This enables Steveslist sellers to automate not just the listing of items, but also the selling and shipping of them too.\nWebhook complications\nWebhooks come with two main complications - security and reliability. First, let’s talk security. The endpoint to which the seller instructs us to send their webhooks is accessible to anyone on the internet. Anyone who knows the URL can send it fake webhooks, and if our seller isn’t careful this could allow an attacker to trick them into, for example, sending the attacker free stuff. A seller’s webhook URL should be difficult to find, since the seller won’t publicize its existence, but obscurity is not the same as security.\nTo allow our sellers to verify that a webhook really was sent by Steveslist, we cryptographically sign our webhook contents.\nCryptographic signing\nCryptographic signing is a deep and subtle topic. Here’s a condensed version of how we use it to secure our webhooks.\nWhen a seller enables webhooks for their account, we generate a random “shared secret key”. We tell the seller to copy this key over to their webhook-receiving server and keep it secure, so that its value is known only by us and the seller. Whenever we send a webhook, we take this shared secret, combine it with the contents of the webhook by using a cryptographic hash function called HMAC, and get back a long, random-seeming, but entirely deterministic “signature” for the webhook.\n<code>Webhook contents +----------+\n(eg. {\"id\": 123...}) | v +---+----------+ |HMAC Algorithm|-----&gt;Webhook signature +---+----------+ ^\nShared secret key |\n(eg. 123mhu23jy8xdwgmd...)+---+\n</code>\nWe include this signature in our webhook body, for example:\n<code><span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">action</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">item_sold</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">price</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"mi\">100</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"c1\">// ...more params...</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">signature</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"p\">:</span> <span class=\"dl\">\"</span><span class=\"s2\">234gj98d49j834978gf39t78ndn98g7dq3ng897308y7</span><span class=\"dl\">\"</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code>\nWhen the seller’s webhook-receiving server receives a webhook, it takes the shared secret and webhook contents and calculates what it expects the signature to be in exactly the same way that we did. It compares the result to the signature attached to the webhook; if they match then it accepts and processes the webhook. Since the signature can only be generated using the shared secret known only by us and the seller, the webhook-receiving server can be confident that the webhook was sent by us. If the signatures don’t match, however, the server rejects the webhook.\nNote that all of the signature verification code must be written and maintained by the sellers. We can provide them with encouragement and examples, but we can’t force them to verify signatures correctly, or even at all. For some real-world examples, look at how Stripe and GitHub sign their webhooks.\nReliability\nWe also need to consider what happens when our webhooks go wrong and what guarantees we want to make to our users about them. If we try to send a webhook but can’t connect to the user’s server, what should we do? What if we successfully connect to their server and send the webhook, but their server sends back an error? What if we send the webhook but the server hangs for twenty seconds before disconnecting without telling us what happened?\nThere are tradeoffs involved here that require clear communication and a surprising amount of infrastructure to manage. We at Steveslist choose to guarantee that we will deliver webhooks “at least once”. This means that if a webhook fails to send then we will keep trying (a large but not infinite number of times) until it does. If we’re not sure whether a webhook succeeded or failed, we will keep trying until we are sure that an attempt has succeeded. This might occasionally result in us sending the same webhook twice, but it’s the seller’s responsibility to have their code handle this gracefully instead of sending the same customer five stolen TVs instead of the one that they ordered.\n“What do you think so far?” asks Kate. “Is this roughly what you’ve been thinking?” You make a non-committal face and take a big bite of a nearby sandwich in order to preclude any further discussion. Kate continues:\nLet’s talk about the backend systems that will power some of our most important features.\nUser authentication via a password\nMost users sign into the Steveslist website and smartphone apps using a username and password. There are other ways of signing into the website, like OAuth - we’ll cover them another time.\nWe will have to store our users’ passwords very securely. Not only is a user’s password the thing they use to sign in (or authenticate) to Stevelist, but for many users they’re probably the same password that they use to sign in to many other services too, despite all the warnings that this is a bad idea. They only have so many children with so many birthdays, after all.\nRupert Herpton has written the seminal tutorial on how to secure passwords, which I’m sure you’ve read already. Just in case you need a refresher, the crux of the matter is that we mustn’t ever store passwords in their original, plaintext form, anywhere. We mustn’t store them in plaintext in a database, in a log file, or in any other part of our system. Instead, before storing a password, we must first hash it using a hash function such as bcrypt.\nA hash function is a “one-way” function that takes an input and deterministically converts it into a new, seemingly-random string. Calculating a hash value from an input is computationally very easy, but reversing the transformation and recovering the original input from its hash value takes so much time and computing power that it is, practically-speaking, impossible.\n<code>+---------+ Easy +----------+\n| |------------&gt;| |\n|Plaintext| |Hash value|\n| |&lt;------------| |\n+---------+ Essentially +----------+ Impossible\n</code>\nSince we only store the hash values of our users’ passwords, if a hacker somehow stole our password database (heaven forbid) (touch wood) then they would only be able to see the passwords’ hash values. They wouldn’t be able to easily turn these hash values back into plaintext passwords, meaning that they wouldn’t be able to use them to login to Steveslist, and they won’t be able to take advantage of all the people who re-use passwords across different services.\nSince we only store password hash values, when we want to check whether a login password that a user has given us is correct we first calculate its hash value, and compare the result to the hash value in our password database.\n<code> +--------------+ |User's Browser| +-----------+--+\n1.User attempts to | ^\nlog in: | | 3. Server logs the user in | | if password matches, and username: steve | | returns an error if it does not. password: 12345 v | +--+--------+--+ | Steveslist | | Server | +--------------+ |\n2.Server computes | |username|password_hash|\nthe hash of the | +----------------------+\npassword and compares +----&gt;+steve |23jy7213y7jO |\nit to the value in the |kate |21897213hh21 |\ndatabase. |... |... |\n</code>\nAs previously mentioned, we also have to be careful not to log passwords in any of our debug output. This can be an easy mistake to make - if you log all of the parameters of every HTTP request, just in case you need it, you will certainly be logging user passwords. Facebook logged passwords in plaintext for many years, and whilst it didn’t seem to affect their stock price I’m sure it made them feel pretty silly for a day or two.\nKate pauses for breath. You pretend to take notes on your out-of-battery laptop.\nLet’s talk about infrastructure.\nDatabase servers\nSteveslist’s primary data store runs a common flavor of SQL database called MySQL. I won’t talk much about SQL here - the specifics of how it works aren’t too important, and you can find them on Google if you’re interested. Since we are so successful, we have a huge and growing amount of data to manage. We’ve started to become acutely aware that databases aren’t magic. They run on computers, just like any other program. As the volume of data in a database grows, the computer’s hard drive and memory starts to fill up. At the start of the company the easiest way to deal with this problem was to run our database on a single computer (or machine) with an enormous hard drive. But this could only stave off the problem for so long. Eventually our database contained more data than could be stored on any reasonable hard drive, and the database started to get slower and slower as we forced it to search through more and more records.\nWe had to take an entirely new approach, and reconfigure our database to store its data on multiple computers. We did this using sharding.\nSharding\nSharding a database means splitting its data into chunks (or “shards”) and storing each chunk on a separate machine. All of the machines that make up a database are together known as a database cluster. How you split data between machine in your cluster depends on your application and the types of operations you will be performing. For Steveslist we chose to split out our data by user. This means that all of the data for a given user is stored on the same machine. This includes their profile information, their listings, their messages, and so on. Data that doesn’t have a corresponding user (like “Deals of the Day”) can be sharded using a shard key other than user, or not sharded at all if the dataset is sufficiently small.\nThis means that we need an extra “routing” layer in front of our database, which knows which database machine is able to service which queries. We could either make our application servers (the servers that execute our code) responsible for knowing the mapping of user IDs to database shards, or have a centralized “router” that all servers send their requests to, and which is responsible for working out the appropriate machine to forward the request on to. Both approaches have their advantages. Making application servers responsible for maintaining the mapping reduces the number of hops that a request has to make, speeding them up. But having a centralized router makes updating the shard mapping much easier, since you only have to update it in one place.\nIf application servers are responsible for knowing the shard layout, we have a system that looks like this:\n<code> + + + | | | | Requests from users | | | | v v v +------+----------+--------------------+ | Application | | Server | | | |Database sharding config: | |* DB Server 1: IDs between 1-10000 | |* DB Server 2: IDs between 10000-20000| |* DB Server 3: IDs between 20000-30000| +-+----------------+-----------------+-+ | | | |ID:501 |ID:15362 |ID:22361 | | | v v v\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|DB Server 1| |DB Server 2| |DB Server 3|\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n</code>\nIf we have a centralized database router, we have a system that looks like this:\n<code> + + + | | | | Requests from users | | | | v v v +------+----------+--------------------+ | Application | | Server | | | |Database sharding config: | |* ??? Application Server has no idea | +------------+-----------+-------------+ | | Application server sends all database queries to the database router, which forwards them to the correct shard. | | v v +--------------+-----------+-------------+ | Database router | | | |Database sharding config: | |* DB Server 1: IDs between 1-10000 | |* DB Server 2: IDs between 10000-20000 | |* DB Server 3: IDs between 20000-30000 | +---+----------------+---------------+---+ | | | |ID:501 |ID:15362 |ID:22361 | | | v v v\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n|DB Server 1| |DB Server 2| |DB Server 3|\n+-----------+ +-----------+ +-----------+\n</code>\nHow do we decide which database to assign each user to? However we want. We could start by saying that users with odd-numbered IDs are assigned to shard machine 1, and those with even-numbered ones are assigned to shard machine 2. We could hope that this random assignment results in balancing our data relatively evenly between our shards.\nHowever, it’s possible that we might have a small number of power users who create much, much more data than others. Maybe they create so much data that we want to allocate them a shard of their own. This is completely fine - we have complete control over how users are assigned to shards. Random assignments are usually easiest, but are by no means the only option. We can choose to assign users to shards randomly - except for user 367823, who is assigned to shard 15, which no other user is assigned to.\nIf a shard gets too big and starts to fill up its machine’s hard-drive, we can split it up into multiple, smaller shards. How do we migrate the data to these new shards without having to turn off our platform for a while? Probably using a sequential process like:\n“Double-write” new data to both the old and new shards. Continue reading data from the old shard\nCopy over all existing data from the old shard to the new shard. Continue double-writing to old and new shards\nConvince ourselves that the old and new shards contain the same data. We could do this by comparing snapshots of the databases, and/or by reading every query from both databases, comparing them, and alerting if the data is different\nOnce we’re confident that the new and old shards contain the same data, we switch to reading from the new shards. We continue double-writing in case we need to switch back\nOnce we’re confident that this step has been successful, stop double-writing and delete the old shard\nRupert Herpton has written a great article about a broadly-similar type of migration that goes into much more detail. In short, the process of migrating data between database shards is detailed and finicky, but also entirely doable and logical. Some types of database can even automatically take care of sharding for you.\nReplication\nWe will take great care to make sure that our data doesn’t get accidentally deleted and our database servers don’t randomly stop working. But accidents happen, and sometimes computers do randomly stop working. To mitigate the fallout of a database-related disaster, we replicate our data across multiple machines in (close to) realtime.\n<code> Client writes new data to DB Server A | v +-----+-----+ |DB Server A| ++---------++ | | DB Server A quickly replicates v v the new data to DB Servers B and C\n+----------++ +-+---------+\n|DB Server B| |DB Server C|\n+-----------+ +-----------+\n</code>\nRealtime replication has two main benefits. First, it means that if one of our database servers explodes, catches fire, or otherwise stops working, we have multiple almost-perfect copies of it that can seamlessly pick up the slack. In a straightforward, vanilla failure, users of our services may never know that anything has gone wrong. The second benefit of replication is that we can distribute queries for the same data across multiple database servers. If lots of users are asking to read data from the same database, we can split their queries up across all of our copies, meaning that we can handle more queries in parallel.\n<code> Clients can query the same data from any of DB Servers A,B,or C | | | | | | | | | v v v | | | | +-+---+---+-+ | | | | |DB Server A| | | | | +-----------+ | | | | | | v v v v\n+---+-------+ +-----+-+---+\n|DB Server B| |DB Server C|\n+-----------+ +-----------+\n</code>\nNote that database replication is not the same concept as making database backups. Replication happens in (close to) realtime, and is designed to deal on-the-fly with isolated problems in your live (or production) systems. Database backups are performed on a schedule (for example, once a day), and the copies of the data are stored separately, away from production systems. Backups are designed as a final safeguard against widespread, catastrophic data loss, as might happen if all your data centers burned down.\nPretend that you work in the call centre of a big bank, where people are constantly calling you up in order to send money transfers and ask about their current balance. Replication is the equivalent of hurriedly writing down transfer details into multiple books, as you receive them, just in case you lose one of the books. Making backups is the equivalent of photocopying those books once a day and storing the copies in your filing cabinet.\nReplication\nThe process of replication is conceptually quite straightforward. Whenever new data is written to our database, we copy it to multiple machines. This means that if/when a machine fails we can continue querying its siblings, with no user-facing impact. It also means that we can spread our queries out across multiple copies of the same data, resulting in faster query response times.\nHowever, the details of how we do this are important, subtle, and situation-dependent. There’s no right way to do replication - as is so often the case, the exact approach that you take depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your system.\nReplication is complicated by two inconvenient facts about the real world. First, database operations randomly fail sometimes. When we attempt to replicate our data from one server to another, things will occasionally go wrong, causing our machines to become out of sync, at least for a period. Second, even in periods of smooth operation, replication is not instantaneous. When new data is written to our database cluster, some servers in the cluster will always know about the update sooner than others. When choosing a replication strategy we must be aware of these limitations and how they impact our particular application. For example, maybe it’s OK to risk the number of “likes” on a post being slightly out of sync and out of date, but not the amount of money in a user’s bank account.\nOne of the biggest decisions we must make when choosing a replication strategy is whether we want our replication to be synchronous or asynchronous.\nAsynchronous vs synchronous replication\nReplication can be handled either synchronously or asynchronously. These words come up in a lot of different places in systems design, but they always fundamentally mean the same thing. If an action is performed “synchronously” then this means that it is performed while something waits for it. If you wanted to send a letter synchronously then you would got to the Post Office, give your letter to a postal worker, sit and wait in the corner of the Post Office for a few days, and only go home when the postal worker confirmed that your letter had arrived safely.\nBy contrast, if an action is performed “asynchronously” then this means that the initiator of the action doesn’t wait around for it to be finished. Instead, they just continue with the rest of their work while the action is worked on in the background. The real Postal Service is asynchronous; you give your letter to a postal worker, then leave and continue with your life while the Postal Service delivers your letter. Asynchronous actions can send back notifications of the outcome of the action if they want (“Your letter has arrived and was signed for” or “Mr. Heaton, your dry-cleaning is ready”), but they don’t have to.\nHow do these principles apply to database replication? In synchronous replication a client writes its new data to a database server and then waits. This server doesn’t tell the client whether their write has been completed successfully until it has finished fully replicating the client’s data across all of its sibling servers. Then, and only then, does the client continue executing the rest of its code.\nIn asynchronous replication the client writes its data to the first database server, as before. But this time the first server tells the client that the write was successful as soon as it has written the data to its own data store. It kicks off the replication process in the background, and doesn’t wait for it to complete, or even start, before it tells the client that the write was successful. This means that the asynchronous operation appears much faster than the synchronous one, because the client doesn’t have to wait for all the replication to complete before it can continue on with the rest of its work. However, if the background replication fails then the client will believe that it has successfully written its data to the database when it actually has not. This could cause problems, the imagination of which is left as an exercise for the reader.\nThe synchronous approach is slower but “safer” than an asynchronous approach. The database never claims to have successfully received and stored any data until it has finished every single step of doing so. Because the client waits for full confirmation before proceeding, it is guaranteed to never encounter a situation where the client believes that it has written some data to the database, but the database has secretly partially dropped the data on the floor.\nWhich approach is better? It depends. Do you care more about speed or correctness? Is it OK to occasionally have inconsistent data if it significantly speeds up the system’s operation? Or will even a single mistake cause airplanes to start falling out of the sky?\nDatabase replication systems face other interesting problems too. Many of these problems are “logical” rather than “technical”, and don’t require a detailed understanding of the complex software and networking protocols underlying the system. To help picture some of them, imagine that you’re back in the call centre from a few paragraphs ago. You work with many other colleagues. Together you play the role of database servers. People call you up to transfer money and ask about their current balance. You and your colleagues write information about new transfers down on paper, and replicate it between yourselves by calling each other up.\nThe problems faced by our database cluster are identical to those faced by our call-centre. What happens if two people call in and try to update the same piece of data at the same time by talking to two different employees? Maybe we solve that by having a “leader” employee who is the only one authorized to serve calls from people trying to create transfers. All the other employees are only allowed to answer queries about current balances. OK, so what happens if the leader has a stroke and dies after they’ve received some new data, but before they’ve told everyone else about it? What if a “follower” employee has a temporary seizure for a few seconds and misses some data updates from the leader? What if we’re never entirely sure which of our employees are dead or alive?\nThis is not an approximate metaphor that breaks down if you look too hard or start asking awkward questions. Understand this weird call-centre and you understand database replication. Read this blog post and you really understand replication.\nBackups\nIn addition to realtime replication, we also store regular backups of our entire database in order to protect against catastrophic disaster. We copy all of the data in our database, store it somewhere safe, and mark it as something like “database backup, 2020-05-11:01:00”.\n<code>+----------+ | Database +----------------&gt; database backup, 2020-05-11:01:00\n+----------+ database backup, 2020-05-10:01:00 database backup, 2020-05-09:01:00\n</code>\nIf our entire database - or some fraction of it - somehow gets wiped out, we grab the most recent backup available and load it into new database machines.\n<code>+----------+\n| New |\n| Database +&lt;---------------- database backup, 2020-05-11:01:00\n+----------+ database backup, 2020-05-10:01:00 database backup, 2020-05-09:01:00\n</code>\nSuch a calamity could be caused by a cyberattack, a disaster in our data centre, a database migration gone horribly wrong, or any number of unlikely but potentially company-destroying reasons. Unlike realtime replication, restoring a database from a backup is a slow process that our users will definitely notice. Our entire system will likely be offline until the restoration is complete. We will have lost all database updates that occurred after the last backup but before the disaster. And there will no doubt be a large number of knock-on effects as users and systems try to access data that used to be there but is now lost forever. Nonetheless, these are all much less terrible than the complete, irrevocable loss of all our company’s data and with it, our company.\nThat’s a whole lot of detail about our primary SQL database. Let’s talk about some other ways in which we store and query data.\nFree-text searching\nA standard SQL database is very good at answering well-defined and specific queries. For example:\nGive me all the item listings created by user #145122 in the last 90 days\nGive me the listing details for item #237326921\nGive me the count of new listings per day created in San Francisco with the label “Electronics”\nYou can retrieve this kind of data using SQL queries that look something like this:\n<code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">user_id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"mi\">145122</span> <span class=\"k\">AND</span> <span class=\"n\">created</span> <span class=\"o\">&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">currentDate</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"o\">-</span> <span class=\"mi\">90</span>\n</code>\nor\n<code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"n\">DATE_TRUNC</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'day'</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">created</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"k\">AS</span> <span class=\"k\">day</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"k\">COUNT</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span> <span class=\"k\">AS</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span>\n<span class=\"k\">INNER</span> <span class=\"k\">JOIN</span> <span class=\"n\">labels</span> <span class=\"k\">as</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span> <span class=\"k\">ON</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">id</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">item_id</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">i</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">city</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'San Francisco'</span> <span class=\"k\">AND</span> <span class=\"n\">l</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nb\">text</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'electronics'</span>\n<span class=\"k\">GROUP</span> <span class=\"k\">BY</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n<span class=\"k\">ORDER</span> <span class=\"k\">BY</span> <span class=\"mi\">1</span> <span class=\"k\">DESC</span>\n</code>\nYou’ll notice that these queries contain a lot of very “precise” operators, like equals- and greater-than-signs. But how would you write a SQL query that could return a list of items that match a Google-style “full-text” search, like “second-hand TV”?\nThis would be difficult. You could try the SQL LIKE operator, which allows you to find records containing a pattern, such as a sub-string. For example, the following query finds all items with a description containing the sub-string second-hand TV:\n<code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"k\">LIKE</span> <span class=\"s1\">'%second-hand TV%'</span>\n</code>\nHowever, this query will only match the very specific sub-string that it was given. It won’t match “TV that is second-hand” or “2nd-hand TV”, or “sceond-hnad TV”. Given enough perseverance you could theoretically construct a giant SQL-query that covered as many of these permutations as you had patience for:\n<code><span class=\"k\">SELECT</span> <span class=\"o\">*</span>\n<span class=\"k\">FROM</span> <span class=\"n\">items</span>\n<span class=\"k\">WHERE</span> <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"k\">LIKE</span> <span class=\"s1\">'%second%hand%TV'</span> <span class=\"k\">OR</span> <span class=\"n\">description</span> <span class=\"k\">LIKE</span> <span class=\"s1\">'%second%TV%hand'</span> <span class=\"k\">OR</span> <span class=\"c1\">-- …and so on and so on for another bajillion ORs…</span>\n</code>\nHowever, the resulting query would be slow and cumbersome, and would still miss many important edge-cases that you hadn’t thought of. And even if you did get back a useful list of search results, you’d still have a lot of work left to do in order to decide how to order them. The ordering you want isn’t something strict like “most-recent first” or “alphabetically by title”. Instead it’s some much woolier notion of “best” or “most-relevant” first.\nAll of this means that SQL databases are generally not very good at full-text searches. Fortunately, other types of database are, including one called Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch is often described as a document-oriented database. We don’t need to go into the details of how exactly it works, but the important part for us is that, unlike SQL databases, Elasticsearch is very good at taking queries like “second-hand TV” and returning a list, ordered by “relevance,” of the fuzzy matches that users have come to expect from their search engines.\n“Sounds like Elasticsearch is just better than SQL,” you might say. “Should we throw away our SQL databases and put everything in Elasticsearch instead?” Not so fast. Elasticsearch, and other databases like it, have their strengths, but they also have their weaknesses. They’re typically somewhat less reliable than SQL databases, and are somewhat more likely to accidentally lose data at large scale. They’re also often much slower to write new data to.\nAs we’ve already noted, there’s rarely a single, universally “best” tool for any type of job. There’s certainly no such thing as “the best” database. Instead, different databases have different strengths and weaknesses, and different solutions are appropriate for different tasks. At Steveslist, we care so much about making sure that we use the right tool for the right job that we store our data in both a SQL database and a document-oriented database like Elasticsearch.\nWe use our SQL database as our primary data store. It is our authoritative “source-of-truth”, and we write all our new data to it before we write it anywhere else. We do all our simple, precise reads from it, especially when accuracy and up-to-date-ness are our principal requirements. If we want to show a user a list of all their open listings, we read it from our SQL database. If we want to validate a users password, we read that from our SQL database too. This plays to the strengths of SQL databases.\nHowever, in the background we also copy data from our SQL database into an Elasticsearch database, and send any full-text search queries made via our search box to Elasticsearch. This means that we benefit from the strengths of Elasticsearch, and are not impacted too much by its weaknesses. We copy over batches of records every few minutes, hours, or days, depending on the requirements of the specific dataset. Alternatively, we could watch the logs of our SQL database for new or updated records, and create or update the corresponding Elasticsearch records in near-realtime.\n<code> | | |\nNew data is always | |Queries for |Full-text search written to the SQL | |specific data go |queries go to\nDB first | |to the SQL DB too |Elasticsearch V V V +--------------+ +---------------+ | SQL Database +------&gt;+ Elasticsearch | +--------------+ +---------------+ New data is copied over from the SQL DB to Elasticsearch\n</code>\nWhen scouting Steveslist’s competition, I noticed that when you create a new Craigslist listing it says “your listing will be visible in search within the next 15 minutes”. I’ll bet pesos to pizza that this is because their primary datastore is a SQL database, but their search box is powered by an Elasticsearch-like engine. Their pipeline for replicating data from SQL to search probably takes around 15 minutes, which they’ve decided (very reasonably) is an acceptable delay for their particular use-case.\nWe’ve said that Elasticsearch is somewhat less reliable than most SQL databases. If Elasticsearch accidentally loses a few of our records then they won’t appear in search results. This would be a shame that would make our product a bit worse, and we try our hardest to avoid it happening. However, it wouldn’t be a disaster in the same way that losing data from our primary data store would be. We only copy data over to Elasticsearch once it has been written to and safely captured by our source-of-truth SQL database, which is what really matters.\nIt’s 6pm, and the library is closing. A librarian tries to ask you to leave. Kate shoos him away with a barrage of crumpled-up balls of paper.\nInternal tools\nManaging the Steveslist platform requires bespoke internal tools. We need to perform a wide range of administrative tasks, like deleting listings that are too illegal (even for us), issuing refunds, viewing a user’s personal details in order to help with support requests, and so on. Many of these tools will be used by people who work on other teams at Steveslist, like finance, compliance, legal, sales, and support. Since the tasks they need to perform are so specific to the way that Steveslist works, we can’t do them using third-party tools, and have to build our own instead.\nIn the early days, we baked this functionality into the main Stevelist product and only exposed it to users who had the is_steveslist_employee = True database flag set. This was an OK approach for a small company, but was also fragile and easy to mess up. It was scary to think that we were exposing all of our superuser powers through the same servers that run our main product. It made the potential consequences of a security flaw in our application much worse, and created new types of mistake for us to make, such as forgetting to disable the is_steveslist_employee flag for an acrimoniously fired employee.\nOnce Steveslist reached a certain level of maturity, we built ourselves an entirely separate admin platform, with separate, hardened authentication and authorization. The service runs on entirely separate servers, and requires a VPN and a TLS client certificate to access (which we’ll talk about another day). This separated out our internal- and external-facing products, and drastically reduced the chance of a boneheaded error exposing our admin tools to the world. We’re frequently building new internal tools - one for user administration, one for server management, one for fraud detection, and so on. These services all talk to the same database as our user-facing products, so they all have access to the same data. They just run on different servers that are completely inaccessible to the outside world.\nCron jobs\nThere are lots of tasks that we’ll want our system to perform at fixed times and intervals. For example:\nEmailing ourselves weekly usage reports\nSending marketing emails to users\nCharging the credit cards users who have a subscription plan with us\nCopying data from our SQL database to Elasticsearch\nThe most common tool used for running scheduled jobs is called cron, a tool that is built into Unix operating systems. It’s so common that people will often call any kind of scheduled job a “cron job”, even when it’s not actually being run by cron.\nYou can set up a cron job on your own computer by running:\n<code>crontab -e\n</code>\nThen typing into the prompt:\n<code>*/5 * * * * $YOUR_COMMAND\n</code>\nThis will cause your computer to execute $YOUR_COMMAND every 5 minutes.\nSteveslist currently has a very simple and slightly fragile cron setup. We have a single “scheduled jobs server”. We use crontab on this server (as above) to tell it the commands that we want it to run, and the schedule that we want it to run them on. This setup isn’t scaling very well - if the scheduled jobs server explodes or even hiccups then we don’t always know which jobs it did and didn’t run, and have to scramble to bring up a replacement server. And even though the server is very beefy and powerful, eventually we’re going to want to run more jobs than it can handle at once. We’re considering either splitting up our cron jobs into multiple servers, or setting up a new system using a modern tool like Kubernetes.\nPubsub\nActions have consequences. This is both the subject line of the sinister emails that we send to people who write mean things about us on the internet, and the reason we have a pubsub system.\nWhen a new user signs up, we want to send them an email welcoming them to Steveslist and reminding them about the action-consequence relationship I just described. When a new listing is added for a stolen TV in San Francisco, we want to notify users who have set up search alerts for TVs in the Bay Area. When a card is declined for a subscription, we want to email the responsible user to politely threaten them. When a new listing is added, we want to perform some extremely cursory anti-fraud checks. When an item is purchased, we want to sent a webhook to its seller. And so on.\nTechnically, all of these actions could be performed synchronously (rememberer that word?) by the server executing the initiating action. However, this is often a bad idea, for two reasons. First, the response action (such as emailing all the users who are subscribed for notifications about new stolen TVs) may be very slow. Performing the response action synchronously means that if the initiating action was performed by a user then they will have to wait for all the response actions to finish too. This might not be the end of the world if the response action is small and quick, like sending a single email. But if it’s larger - like searching for and notifying all users who might be interested in a new item - then, well, it still won’t be the end of the world, but it will be a bad user experience.\nTo mitigate this problem we have built a “publish-subscribe” or “pubsub” system. When a trigger action is performed, the code that performs it “publishes an event” describing the action, such as NewListingCreated or SubscriptionCardDeclined. The words “event” and “publish” are quite loosely defined in this context, and don’t have a rigorous technical definition. An event is just some sort of record of something that happened, and to publish an event just means that you somehow make a note that something happened. The details of how you do so depend entirely on the pubsub system in question. In a simple system events might be stored in tables in a SQL database, and code would publish events by writing new records to a table.\nIf a programmer at Steveslist wants a response action to be performed whenever a new event of a particular type is published, they can write a consumer. This is a piece of code that “subscribes” to a type of event, and which is executed whenever a new event of that type is published. It uses the details of the event (for example, the user whose subscription payment failed) to asynchronously execute whatever actions the programmer wants (for example, sending the user a menacing email).\nPubsub systems are often managed by a central message broker. Systems publish events to the broker, and the broker is then responsible for getting the events to any subscribed consumers. This can be achieved using either a push or a pull mechanism. Consumers can pull messages from the broker by polling it and repeatedly asking “any new events? any new events?” or they can wait and listen and the broker can push notifications of new events out to them, for example by sending them an HTTP request.\n<code>1. New user signs|\nup to Steveslist | v +-----------------+ +------------------------+ |Steveslist Server| +--&gt;+SendWelcomeEmailConsumer| +---------+-------+ | +------------------------+ | v\n2. Server reports| +-------------++ 4. Consumers send welcome\na NewUserSignup +----&gt;+Pub/Sub Broker| emails, check for spam,\nevent to the +-------------++ etc.\nPub/Sub system ^ 3. Pub/Sub broker | +------------------------+ notifies consumers +--&gt;+NewUserSpamCheckConsumer| that have subscribed to +------------------------+ NewUserSignup events.\n</code>\nPubsub systems have many benefits:\nNon-critical actions are performed asynchronously, keeping the user experience snappy\nOur code is kept clean and well-separated. The code that publishes an event doesn’t have to care about what the events’ subscribers do in response\nIf a subscriber’s action fails for some reason (for example, the email-sending system has a hiccup), the pubsub system can note this failure and retry again later\nNext, let’s talk big data.\nBig data and analytics\nIn order to understand and optimize our business, we need to be able to calculate complex statistics across the entire Steveslist platform. How many listings are created every day, segmented by country and city? How many users who signed up each month have created a listing within 90 days of signing up?\nTo do this, we need to write database queries that aggregate over the entirety of our data. We don’t want to run these queries against our production SQL database, because they could put an enormous amount of load on it. We don’t want a huge query issued by an internal analyst to be able to bring our production database to a grinding halt, but we do want to provide this analyst with a tool that is well-suited to their needs. To complicate matters further, database engines that are quick at small queries (like returning all the listings belonging to a single user) are typically unacceptably slow (or indeed incapable) of answering giant queries (like calculating the total dollars spent on listings in each category, per day, for the last 90 days).\nDespite this, for the first year or so after Steveslist was founded, we took a risk and simply ran our analytics queries against the main production database. This was a gamble, but it just about worked. We didn’t have much data anyway, and we had more important things to focus on, like attracting the customers who would create the big data that would one day mean that we had to find a more scalable solution.\nEventually we did bring down the production database with an overly-ambitious query, and decided that the time had come to invest in a data warehouse. A data warehouse is a data store that is well-suited to large, system-wide queries. Our warehouse is powered by a database engine called Hive, but we could also have chosen Presto, Impala, Redshift, or any number of competing alternatives. Hive accepts queries written in SQL, but is much better at executing these queries against giant datasets than our MySQL database is.\nWe replicate our data from our production SQL database to Hive, once a day, overnight. Steveslist analysts and programmers can query the same dataset using whichever database engine best suits their needs. They can use the production SQL database for small, precise, source-of-truth queries from production systems; Elasticsearch for full-text search queries; or the data warehouse for huge queries that aggregate over vast volumes of data.\nIt’s dark outside and you’re hungry. Is that pretty much it? you ask.\n“Oh god no,” Kate replies, “we could keep going forever. But this is a pretty good start. It’s helpful to have a broad understanding of a wide range of topics, but no one needs to know the details about everything. I find that once you know some basics you can keep picking up more basics and even a couple of details as you go along.”\nYou ask if Kate could perhaps continue to elaborate on her five-year vision for Steveslist tomorrow.\n“Absolutely,” says Kate.

What remains is a minimum of\n   information that must be understood by the professional working in a\n   TCP/IP environment.  These professionals include the systems\n   administrator, the systems programmer, and the network manager.\n\n   This tutorial uses examples from the UNIX TCP/IP environment, however\n   the main points apply across all implementations of TCP/IP.\n\n   Note that the purpose of this memo is explanation, not definition.\n   If any question arises about the correct specification of a protocol,\n   please refer to the actual standards defining RFC.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                               [Page 1]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-2\" id=\"page-2\" href=\"#page-2\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   The next section is an overview of TCP/IP, followed by detailed\n   descriptions of individual components.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2\" href=\"#section-2\">2</a>.

In summary: if\n   it is on an Ethernet it is called an Ethernet frame; if it is between\n   the Ethernet driver and the IP module it is called a IP packet; if it\n   is between the IP module and the UDP module it is called a UDP\n   datagram; if it is between the IP module and the TCP module it is\n   called a TCP segment (more generally, a transport message); and if it\n   is in a network application it is called a application message.\n\n   These definitions are imperfect.  Actual definitions vary from one\n   publication to the next.  More specific definitions can be found in\n   <a href=\"./rfc1122#section-1.3.3\">RFC 1122, section&nbsp;1.3.3</a>.\n\n   A driver is software that communicates directly with the network\n   interface hardware.  A module is software that communicates with a\n   driver, with network applications, or with another module.\n\n   The terms driver, module, Ethernet frame, IP packet, UDP datagram,\n   TCP message, and application message are used where appropriate\n   throughout this tutorial.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.3\" href=\"#section-2.3\">2.3</a>  Flow of Data</h3></span>\n\n   Let's follow the data as it flows down through the protocol stack\n   shown in Figure 1.  For an application that uses TCP (Transmission\n   Control Protocol), data passes between the application and the TCP\n   module.  For applications that use UDP (User Datagram Protocol), data\n   passes between the application and the UDP module.  FTP (File\n   Transfer Protocol) is a typical application that uses TCP.  Its\n   protocol stack in this example is FTP/TCP/IP/ENET.  SNMP (Simple\n   Network Management Protocol) is an application that uses UDP.  Its\n   protocol stack in this example is SNMP/UDP/IP/ENET.\n\n   The TCP module, UDP module, and the Ethernet driver are n-to-1\n   multiplexers.  As multiplexers they switch many inputs to one output.\n   They are also 1-to-n de-multiplexers.  As de-multiplexers they switch\n   one input to many outputs according to the type field in the protocol\n   header.\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                               [Page 3]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-4\" id=\"page-4\" href=\"#page-4\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n         1   2 3 ...   n                   1   2 3 ...   n\n          \\  |      /      |               \\  | |      /       ^\n           \\ | |   /       |                \\ | |     /        |\n         -------------   flow              ----------------   flow\n         |multiplexer|    of               |de-multiplexer|    of\n         -------------   data              ----------------   data\n              |            |                     |              |\n              |            v                     |              |\n              1                                  1\n\n        Figure 2.  n-to-1 multiplexer and 1-to-n de-multiplexer\n\n   If an Ethernet frame comes up into the Ethernet driver off the\n   network, the packet can be passed upwards to either the ARP (Address\n   Resolution Protocol) module or to the IP (Internet Protocol) module.\n   The value of the type field in the Ethernet frame determines whether\n   the Ethernet frame is passed to the ARP or the IP module.\n\n   If an IP packet comes up into IP, the unit of data is passed upwards\n   to either TCP or UDP, as determined by the value of the protocol\n   field in the IP header.\n\n   If the UDP datagram comes up into UDP, the application message is\n   passed upwards to the network application based on the value of the\n   port field in the UDP header.  If the TCP message comes up into TCP,\n   the application message is passed upwards to the network application\n   based on the value of the port field in the TCP header.\n\n   The downwards multiplexing is simple to perform because from each\n   starting point there is only the one downward path; each protocol\n   module adds its header information so the packet can be de-\n   multiplexed at the destination computer.\n\n   Data passing out from the applications through either TCP or UDP\n   converges on the IP module and is sent downwards through the lower\n   network interface driver.\n\n   Although internet technology supports many different network media,\n   Ethernet is used for all examples in this tutorial because it is the\n   most common physical network used under IP.  The computer in Figure 1\n   has a single Ethernet connection.  The 6-byte Ethernet address is\n   unique for each interface on an Ethernet and is located at the lower\n   interface of the Ethernet driver.\n\n   The computer also has a 4-byte IP address.  This address is located\n   at the lower interface to the IP module.  The IP address must be\n   unique for an internet.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                               [Page 4]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-5\" id=\"page-5\" href=\"#page-5\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   A running computer always knows its own IP address and Ethernet\n   address.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.4\" href=\"#section-2.4\">2.4</a>  Two Network Interfaces</h3></span>\n\n   If a computer is connected to 2 separate Ethernets it is as in Figure\n   3.\n\n                ----------------------------\n                |    network applications  |\n                |                          |\n                |...  \\ | /  ..  \\ | /  ...|\n                |     -----      -----     |\n                |     |TCP|      |UDP|     |\n                |     -----      -----     |\n                |         \\      /         |\n                |         --------         |\n                |         |  IP  |         |\n                |  -----  -*----*-  -----  |\n                |  |ARP|   |    |   |ARP|  |\n                |  -----   |    |   -----  |\n                |      \\   |    |   /      |\n                |      ------  ------      |\n                |      |ENET|  |ENET|      |\n                |      ---@--  ---@--      |\n                ----------|-------|---------\n                          |       |\n                          |    ---o---------------------------\n                          |             Ethernet Cable 2\n           ---------------o----------\n             Ethernet Cable 1\n\n             Figure 3.

A computer that has been dedicated\n   to the task of forwarding IP packets is called an \"IP-router\".\n\n   As you can see from the figure, the forwarded IP packet never touches\n   the TCP and UDP modules on the IP-router.

Each module or driver strips the\n   corresponding header from the message as the message climbs the\n   protocol stack up towards the application.  The IP header contains\n   the IP address, which builds a single logical network from multiple\n   physical networks.  This interconnection of physical networks is the\n   source of the name: internet.

Users of general-purpose\n   computers benefit from the installation of an internet because of the\n   interoperability in computers on the market.

Ethernet</h2></span>\n\n   This section is a short review of Ethernet technology.\n\n   An Ethernet frame contains the destination address, source address,\n   type field, and data.\n\n   An Ethernet address is 6 bytes.  Every device has its own Ethernet\n   address and listens for Ethernet frames with that destination\n   address.  All devices also listen for Ethernet frames with a wild-\n   card destination address of \"FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF\" (in hexadecimal),\n   called a \"broadcast\" address.\n\n   Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense and Multiple Access with\n   Collision Detection).  CSMA/CD means that all devices communicate on\n   a single medium, that only one can transmit at a time, and that they\n   can all receive simultaneously.  If 2 devices try to transmit at the\n   same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices\n   wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit again.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-3.1\" href=\"#section-3.1\">3.1</a>  A Human Analogy</h3></span>\n\n   A good analogy of Ethernet technology is a group of people talking in\n   a small, completely dark room.  In this analogy, the physical network\n   medium is sound waves on air in the room instead of electrical\n   signals on a coaxial cable.\n\n   Each person can hear the words when another is talking (Carrier\n   Sense).  Everyone in the room has equal capability to talk (Multiple\n   Access), but none of them give lengthy speeches because they are\n   polite.  If a person is impolite, he is asked to leave the room\n   (i.e., thrown off the net).\n\n   No one talks while another is speaking.  But if two people start\n   speaking at the same instant, each of them know this because each\n   hears something they haven't said (Collision Detection).  When these\n   two people notice this condition, they wait for a moment, then one\n   begins talking.  The other hears the talking and waits for the first\n   to finish before beginning his own speech.\n\n   Each person has an unique name (unique Ethernet address) to avoid\n   confusion.  Every time one of them talks, he prefaces the message\n   with the name of the person he is talking to and with his own name\n   (Ethernet destination and source address, respectively), i.e., \"Hello\n   Jane, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah...\".

ARP</h2></span>\n\n   When sending out an IP packet, how is the destination Ethernet\n   address determined?\n\n   ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to translate IP addresses\n   to Ethernet addresses.  The translation is done only for outgoing IP\n   packets, because this is when the IP header and the Ethernet header\n   are created.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-4.1\" href=\"#section-4.1\">4.1</a>  ARP Table for Address Translation</h3></span>\n\n   The translation is performed with a table look-up.  The table, called\n   the ARP table, is stored in memory and contains a row for each\n   computer.  There is a column for IP address and a column for Ethernet\n   address.  When translating an IP address to an Ethernet address, the\n   table is searched for a matching IP address.  The following is a\n   simplified ARP table:\n\n                  ------------------------------------\n                  |IP address       Ethernet address |\n                  ------------------------------------\n                  |223.1.2.1        08-00-39-00-2F-C3|\n                  |223.1.2.3        08-00-5A-21-A7-22|\n                  |223.1.2.4        08-00-10-99-AC-54|\n                  ------------------------------------\n                      TABLE 1.  Example ARP Table\n\n   The human convention when writing out the 4-byte IP address is each\n   byte in decimal and separating bytes with a period.  When writing out\n   the 6-byte Ethernet address, the conventions are each byte in\n   hexadecimal and separating bytes with either a minus sign or a colon.\n\n   The ARP table is necessary because the IP address and Ethernet\n   address are selected independently; you can not use an algorithm to\n   translate IP address to Ethernet address.  The IP address is selected\n   by the network manager based on the location of the computer on the\n   internet.  When the computer is moved to a different part of an\n   internet, its IP address must be changed.  The Ethernet address is\n   selected by the manufacturer based on the Ethernet address space\n   licensed by the manufacturer.  When the Ethernet hardware interface\n   board changes, the Ethernet address changes.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-4.2\" href=\"#section-4.2\">4.2</a>  Typical Translation Scenario</h3></span>\n\n   During normal operation a network application, such as TELNET, sends\n   an application message to TCP, then TCP sends the corresponding TCP\n   message to the IP module.

At this point the IP\n   packet has been constructed and is ready to be given to the Ethernet\n   driver, but first the destination Ethernet address must be\n   determined.\n\n   The ARP table is used to look-up the destination Ethernet address.\n\n   4.3  ARP Request/Response Pair\n\n   But how does the ARP table get filled in the first place?  The answer\n   is that it is filled automatically by ARP on an \"as-needed\" basis.\n\n   Two things happen when the ARP table can not be used to translate an\n   address:\n\n     1. An ARP request packet with a broadcast Ethernet address is sent\n        out on the network to every computer.\n\n     2. The outgoing IP packet is queued.\n\n   Every computer's Ethernet interface receives the broadcast Ethernet\n   frame.  Each Ethernet driver examines the Type field in the Ethernet\n   frame and passes the ARP packet to the ARP module.  The ARP request\n   packet says \"If your IP address matches this target IP address, then\n   please tell me your Ethernet address\".  An ARP request packet looks\n   something like this:\n\n                ---------------------------------------\n                |Sender IP Address   223.1.2.1        |\n                |Sender Enet Address 08-00-39-00-2F-C3|\n                ---------------------------------------\n                |Target IP Address   223.1.2.2        |\n                |Target Enet Address &lt;blank&gt;          |\n                ---------------------------------------\n                     TABLE 2.  Example ARP Request\n\n   Each ARP module examines the IP address and if the Target IP address\n   matches its own IP address, it sends a response directly to the\n   source Ethernet address.  The ARP response packet says \"Yes, that\n   target IP address is mine, let me give you my Ethernet address\".  An\n   ARP response packet has the sender/target field contents swapped as\n   compared to the request.  It looks something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 10]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-11\" id=\"page-11\" href=\"#page-11\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n                ---------------------------------------\n                |Sender IP Address   223.1.2.2        |\n                |Sender Enet Address 08-00-28-00-38-A9|\n                ---------------------------------------\n                |Target IP Address   223.1.2.1        |\n                |Target Enet Address 08-00-39-00-2F-C3|\n                ---------------------------------------\n                     TABLE 3.

As you remember from\n   step 2 above, the outgoing IP packet was queued.  Next, the IP\n   address to Ethernet address translation is performed by look-up in\n   the ARP table then the Ethernet frame is transmitted on the Ethernet.\n   Therefore, with the new steps 3, 4, and 5, the scenario for the\n   sender computer is:\n\n     1. An ARP request packet with a broadcast Ethernet address is sent\n        out on the network to every computer.\n\n     2. The outgoing IP packet is queued.\n\n     3. The ARP response arrives with the IP-to-Ethernet address\n        translation for the ARP table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 11]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-12\" id=\"page-12\" href=\"#page-12\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n     4. For the queued IP packet, the ARP table is used to translate the\n        IP address to the Ethernet address.\n\n     5. The Ethernet frame is transmitted on the Ethernet.\n\n   In summary, when the translation is missing from the ARP table, one\n   IP packet is queued.  The translation data is quickly filled in with\n   ARP request/response and the queued IP packet is transmitted.\n\n   Each computer has a separate ARP table for each of its Ethernet\n   interfaces.  If the target computer does not exist, there will be no\n   ARP response and no entry in the ARP table.  IP will discard outgoing\n   IP packets sent to that address.  The upper layer protocols can't\n   tell the difference between a broken Ethernet and the absence of a\n   computer with the target IP address.\n\n   Some implementations of IP and ARP don't queue the IP packet while\n   waiting for the ARP response.  Instead the IP packet is discarded and\n   the recovery from the IP packet loss is left to the TCP module or the\n   UDP network application.  This recovery is performed by time-out and\n   retransmission.  The retransmitted message is successfully sent out\n   onto the network because the first copy of the message has already\n   caused the ARP table to be filled.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5\" href=\"#section-5\">5</a>.  Internet Protocol</h2></span>\n\n   The IP module is central to internet technology and the essence of IP\n   is its route table.  IP uses this in-memory table to make all\n   decisions about routing an IP packet.  The content of the route table\n   is defined by the network administrator.  Mistakes block\n   communication.\n\n   To understand how a route table is used is to understand\n   internetworking.  This understanding is necessary for the successful\n   administration and maintenance of an IP network.\n\n   The route table is best understood by first having an overview of\n   routing, then learning about IP network addresses, and then looking\n   at the details.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.1\" href=\"#section-5.1\">5.1</a>  Direct Routing</h3></span>\n\n   The figure below is of a tiny internet with 3 computers: A, B, and C.\n   Each computer has the same TCP/IP protocol stack as in Figure 1.\n   Each computer's Ethernet interface has its own Ethernet address.\n   Each computer has an IP address assigned to the IP interface by the\n   network manager, who also has assigned an IP network number to the\n   Ethernet.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 12]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-13\" id=\"page-13\" href=\"#page-13\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n                          A      B      C\n                          |      |      |\n                        --o------o------o--\n                        Ethernet 1\n                        IP network \"development\"\n\n                       Figure 6.

Computer D is the IP-router; it is connected to\n   all 3 networks and therefore has 3 IP addresses and 3 Ethernet\n   addresses.  Computer D has a TCP/IP protocol stack similar to that in\n   Figure 3, except that it has 3 ARP modules and 3 Ethernet drivers\n   instead of 2.  Please note that computer D has only one IP module.\n\n   The network manager has assigned a unique number, called an IP\n   network number, to each of the Ethernets.  The IP network numbers are\n   not shown in this diagram, just the network names.\n\n   When computer A sends an IP packet to computer B, the process is\n   identical to the single network example above.  Any communication\n   between computers located on a single IP network matches the direct\n   routing example discussed previously.\n\n   When computer D and A communicate, it is direct communication.  When\n   computer D and E communicate, it is direct communication.  When\n   computer D and H communicate, it is direct communication.  This is\n   because each of these pairs of computers is on the same IP network.\n\n   However, when computer A communicates with a computer on the far side\n   of the IP-router, communication is no longer direct.  A must use D to\n   forward the IP packet to the next IP network.  This communication is\n   called \"indirect\".\n\n   This routing of IP packets is done by IP modules and happens\n   transparently to TCP, UDP, and the network applications.\n\n   If A sends an IP packet to E, the source IP address and the source\n   Ethernet address are A's.  The destination IP address is E's, but\n   because A's IP module sends the IP packet to D for forwarding, the\n   destination Ethernet address is D's.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 14]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-15\" id=\"page-15\" href=\"#page-15\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n                ----------------------------------------\n                |address            source  destination|\n                ----------------------------------------\n                |IP header          A       E          |\n                |Ethernet header    A       D          |\n                ----------------------------------------\n       TABLE 6.

For the computer in table 1, with\n   an IP address of 223.1.2.1, the network number is 223.1.2 and the\n   host number is number 1.\n\n   The portion of the address that is used for network number and for\n   host number is defined by the upper bits in the 4-byte address.  All\n   example IP addresses in this tutorial are of type class C, meaning\n   that the upper 3 bits indicate that 21 bits are the network number\n   and 8 bits are the host number.  This allows 2,097,152 class C\n   networks up to 254 hosts on each network.\n\n   The IP address space is administered by the NIC (Network Information\n   Center).  All internets that are connected to the single world-wide\n   Internet must use network numbers assigned by the NIC.  If you are\n   setting up your own internet and you are not intending to connect it\n   to the Internet, you should still obtain your network numbers from\n   the NIC.  If you pick your own number, you run the risk of confusion\n   and chaos in the eventuality that your internet is connected to\n   another internet.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.5\" href=\"#section-5.5\">5.5</a>  Names</h3></span>\n\n   People refer to computers by names, not numbers.  A computer called\n   alpha might have the IP address of 223.1.2.1.  For small networks,\n   this name-to-address translation data is often kept on each computer\n   in the \"hosts\" file.  For larger networks, this translation data file\n   is stored on a server and accessed across the network when needed.  A\n   few lines from that file might look like this:\n\n   223.1.2.1     alpha\n   223.1.2.2     beta\n   223.1.2.3     gamma\n   223.1.2.4     delta\n   223.1.3.2     epsilon\n   223.1.4.2     iota\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 16]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-17\" id=\"page-17\" href=\"#page-17\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   The IP address is the first column and the computer name is the\n   second column.\n\n   In most cases, you can install identical \"hosts\" files on all\n   computers.  You may notice that \"delta\" has only one entry in this\n   file even though it has 3 IP addresses.  Delta can be reached with\n   any of its IP addresses; it does not matter which one is used.  When\n   delta receives an IP packet and looks at the destination address, it\n   will recognize any of its own IP addresses.\n\n   IP networks are also given names.  If you have 3 IP networks, your\n   \"networks\" file for documenting these names might look something like\n   this:\n\n   223.1.2     development\n   223.1.3     accounting\n   223.1.4     factory\n\n   The IP network number is in the first column and its name is in the\n   second column.\n\n   From this example you can see that alpha is computer number 1 on the\n   development network, beta is computer number 2 on the development\n   network and so on.  You might also say that alpha is development.1,\n   Beta is development.2, and so on.\n\n   The above hosts file is adequate for the users, but the network\n   manager will probably replace the line for delta with:\n\n   223.1.2.4     devnetrouter    delta\n   223.1.3.1     facnetrouter\n   223.1.4.1     accnetrouter\n\n   These three new lines for the hosts file give each of delta's IP\n   addresses a meaningful name.  In fact, the first IP address listed\n   has 2 names; \"delta\" and \"devnetrouter\" are synonyms.  In practice\n   \"delta\" is the general-purpose name of the computer and the other 3\n   names are only used when administering the IP route table.\n\n   These files are used by network administration commands and network\n   applications to provide meaningful names.  They are not required for\n   operation of an internet, but they do make it easier for us.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.6\" href=\"#section-5.6\">5.6</a>  IP Route Table</h3></span>\n\n   How does IP know which lower network interface to use when sending\n   out a IP packet?

The path it takes\n   is not determined by a central source but is a result of consulting\n   each of the routing tables used in the journey.  Each computer\n   defines only the next hop in the journey and relies on that computer\n   to send the IP packet on its way.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.12\" href=\"#section-5.12\">5.12</a>  Managing the Routes</h3></span>\n\n   Maintaining correct routing tables on all computers in a large\n   internet is a difficult task; network configuration is being modified\n   constantly by the network managers to meet changing needs.  Mistakes\n   in routing tables can block communication in ways that are\n   excruciatingly tedious to diagnose.\n\n   Keeping a simple network configuration goes a long way towards making\n   a reliable internet.  For instance, the most straightforward method\n   of assigning IP networks to Ethernet is to assign a single IP network\n   number to each Ethernet.\n\n   Help is also available from certain protocols and network\n   applications.  ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) can report\n   some routing problems.  For small networks the route table is filled\n   manually on each computer by the network administrator.  For larger\n   networks the network administrator automates this manual operation\n   with a routing protocol to distribute routes throughout a network.\n\n   When a computer is moved from one IP network to another, its IP\n   address must change.  When a computer is removed from an IP network\n   its old address becomes invalid.  These changes require frequent\n   updates to the \"hosts\" file.  This flat file can become difficult to\n   maintain for even medium-size networks.  The Domain Name System helps\n   solve these problems.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-6\" href=\"#section-6\">6</a>.  User Datagram Protocol</h2></span>\n\n   UDP is one of the two main protocols to reside on top of IP.  It\n   offers service to the user's network applications.  Example network\n   applications that use UDP are:  Network File System (NFS) and Simple\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 22]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-23\" id=\"page-23\" href=\"#page-23\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   Network Management Protocol (SNMP).  The service is little more than\n   an interface to IP.\n\n   UDP is a connectionless datagram delivery service that does not\n   guarantee delivery.  UDP does not maintain an end-to-end connection\n   with the remote UDP module; it merely pushes the datagram out on the\n   net and accepts incoming datagrams off the net.\n\n   UDP adds two values to what is provided by IP.  One is the\n   multiplexing of information between applications based on port\n   number.  The other is a checksum to check the integrity of the data.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-6.1\" href=\"#section-6.1\">6.1</a>  Ports</h3></span>\n\n   How does a client on one computer reach the server on another?\n\n   The path of communication between an application and UDP is through\n   UDP ports.  These ports are numbered, beginning with zero.  An\n   application that is offering service (the server) waits for messages\n   to come in on a specific port dedicated to that service.  The server\n   waits patiently for any client to request service.\n\n   For instance, the SNMP server, called an SNMP agent, always waits on\n   port 161.  There can be only one SNMP agent per computer because\n   there is only one UDP port number 161.  This port number is well\n   known; it is a fixed number, an internet assigned number.  If an SNMP\n   client wants service, it sends its request to port number 161 of UDP\n   on the destination computer.\n\n   When an application sends data out through UDP it arrives at the far\n   end as a single unit.  For example, if an application does 5 writes\n   to the UDP port, the application at the far end will do 5 reads from\n   the UDP port.  Also, the size of each write matches the size of each\n   read.\n\n   UDP preserves the message boundary defined by the application.  It\n   never joins two application messages together, or divides a single\n   application message into parts.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-6.2\" href=\"#section-6.2\">6.2</a>  Checksum</h3></span>\n\n   An incoming IP packet with an IP header type field indicating \"UDP\"\n   is passed up to the UDP module by IP.  When the UDP module receives\n   the UDP datagram from IP it examines the UDP checksum.  If the\n   checksum is zero, it means that checksum was not calculated by the\n   sender and can be ignored.  Thus the sending computer's UDP module\n   may or may not generate checksums.  If Ethernet is the only network\n   between the 2 UDP modules communicating, then you may not need\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 23]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-24\" id=\"page-24\" href=\"#page-24\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   checksumming.  However, it is recommended that checksum generation\n   always be enabled because at some point in the future a route table\n   change may send the data across less reliable media.\n\n   If the checksum is valid (or zero), the destination port number is\n   examined and if an application is bound to that port, an application\n   message is queued for the application to read.  Otherwise the UDP\n   datagram is discarded.  If the incoming UDP datagrams arrive faster\n   than the application can read them and if the queue fills to a\n   maximum value, UDP datagrams are discarded by UDP.  UDP will continue\n   to discard UDP datagrams until there is space in the queue.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-7\" href=\"#section-7\">7</a>.  Transmission Control Protocol</h2></span>\n\n   TCP provides a different service than UDP.  TCP offers a connection-\n   oriented byte stream, instead of a connectionless datagram delivery\n   service.  TCP guarantees delivery, whereas UDP does not.\n\n   TCP is used by network applications that require guaranteed delivery\n   and cannot be bothered with doing time-outs and retransmissions.  The\n   two most typical network applications that use TCP are File Transfer\n   Protocol (FTP) and the TELNET.  Other popular TCP network\n   applications include X-Window System, rcp (remote copy), and the r-\n   series commands.  TCP's greater capability is not without cost: it\n   requires more CPU and network bandwidth.  The internals of the TCP\n   module are much more complicated than those in a UDP module.\n\n   Similar to UDP, network applications connect to TCP ports.  Well-\n   defined port numbers are dedicated to specific applications.  For\n   instance, the TELNET server uses port number 23.  The TELNET client\n   can find the server simply by connecting to port 23 of TCP on the\n   specified computer.\n\n   When the application first starts using TCP, the TCP module on the\n   client's computer and the TCP module on the server's computer start\n   communicating with each other.  These two end-point TCP modules\n   contain state information that defines a virtual circuit.  This\n   virtual circuit consumes resources in both TCP end-points.  The\n   virtual circuit is full duplex; data can go in both directions\n   simultaneously.  The application writes data to the TCP port, the\n   data traverses the network and is read by the application at the far\n   end.\n\n   TCP packetizes the byte stream at will; it does not retain the\n   boundaries between writes.  For example, if an application does 5\n   writes to the TCP port, the application at the far end might do 10\n   reads to get all the data.  Or it might get all the data with a\n   single read.  There is no correlation between the number and size of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 24]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-25\" id=\"page-25\" href=\"#page-25\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   writes at one end to the number and size of reads at the other end.\n\n   TCP is a sliding window protocol with time-out and retransmits.\n   Outgoing data must be acknowledged by the far-end TCP.\n   Acknowledgements can be piggybacked on data.  Both receiving ends can\n   flow control the far end, thus preventing a buffer overrun.\n\n   As with all sliding window protocols, the protocol has a window size.\n   The window size determines the amount of data that can be transmitted\n   before an acknowledgement is required.  For TCP, this amount is not a\n   number of TCP segments but a number of bytes.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8\" href=\"#section-8\">8</a>.  Network Applications</h2></span>\n\n   Why do both TCP and UDP exist, instead of just one or the other?\n\n   They supply different services.  Most applications are implemented to\n   use only one or the other.  You, the programmer, choose the protocol\n   that best meets your needs.  If you need a reliable stream delivery\n   service, TCP might be best.  If you need a datagram service, UDP\n   might be best.  If you need efficiency over long-haul circuits, TCP\n   might be best.  If you need efficiency over fast networks with short\n   latency, UDP might be best.  If your needs do not fall nicely into\n   these categories, then the \"best\" choice is unclear.  However,\n   applications can make up for deficiencies in the choice.  For\n   instance if you choose UDP and you need reliability, then the\n   application must provide reliability.  If you choose TCP and you need\n   a record oriented service, then the application must insert markers\n   in the byte stream to delimit records.\n\n   What network applications are available?\n\n   There are far too many to list.  The number is growing continually.\n   Some of the applications have existed since the beginning of internet\n   technology: TELNET and FTP.  Others are relatively new: X-Windows and\n   SNMP.  The following is a brief description of the applications\n   mentioned in this tutorial.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.1\" href=\"#section-8.1\">8.1</a>  TELNET</h3></span>\n\n   TELNET provides a remote login capability on TCP.  The operation and\n   appearance is similar to keyboard dialing through a telephone switch.\n   On the command line the user types \"telnet delta\" and receives a\n   login prompt from the computer called \"delta\".\n\n   TELNET works well; it is an old application and has widespread\n   interoperability.  Implementations of TELNET usually work between\n   different operating systems.  For instance, a TELNET client may be on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 25]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-26\" id=\"page-26\" href=\"#page-26\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   VAX/VMS and the server on UNIX System V.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.2\" href=\"#section-8.2\">8.2</a>  FTP</h3></span>\n\n   File Transfer Protocol (FTP), as old as TELNET, also uses TCP and has\n   widespread interoperability.  The operation and appearance is as if\n   you TELNETed to the remote computer.  But instead of typing your\n   usual commands, you have to make do with a short list of commands for\n   directory listings and the like.  FTP commands allow you to copy\n   files between computers.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.3\" href=\"#section-8.3\">8.3</a>  rsh</h3></span>\n\n   Remote shell (rsh or remsh) is one of an entire family of remote UNIX\n   style commands.  The UNIX copy command, cp, becomes rcp.  The UNIX\n   \"who is logged in\" command, who, becomes rwho.  The list continues\n   and is referred to collectively to as the \"r\" series commands or the\n   \"r*\" (r star) commands.\n\n   The r* commands mainly work between UNIX systems and are designed for\n   interaction between trusted hosts.  Little consideration is given to\n   security, but they provide a convenient user environment.\n\n   To execute the \"cc file.c\" command on a remote computer called delta,\n   type \"rsh delta cc file.c\".  To copy the \"file.c\" file to delta, type\n   \"rcp file.c delta:\".  To login to delta, type \"rlogin delta\", and if\n   you administered the computers in a certain way, you will not be\n   challenged with a password prompt.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.4\" href=\"#section-8.4\">8.4</a>  NFS</h3></span>\n\n   Network File System, first developed by Sun Microsystems Inc, uses\n   UDP and is excellent for mounting UNIX file systems on multiple\n   computers.  A diskless workstation can access its server's hard disk\n   as if the disk were local to the workstation.  A single disk copy of\n   a database on mainframe \"alpha\" can also be used by mainframe \"beta\"\n   if the database's file system is NFS mounted on \"beta\".\n\n   NFS adds significant load to a network and has poor utility across\n   slow links, but the benefits are strong.  The NFS client is\n   implemented in the kernel, allowing all applications and commands to\n   use the NFS mounted disk as if it were local disk.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.5\" href=\"#section-8.5\">8.5</a>  SNMP</h3></span>\n\n   Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses UDP and is designed\n   for use by central network management stations.  It is a well known\n   fact that if given enough data, a network manager can detect and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale                                              [Page 26]</span></pre>\n<hr class=\"noprint\" style=\"width: 96ex;\" align=\"left\"><!--NewPage--><pre class=\"newpage\"><a name=\"page-27\" id=\"page-27\" href=\"#page-27\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a>                   A TCP/IP Tutorial                January 1991</span>\n\n\n   diagnose network problems.  The central station uses SNMP to collect\n   this data from other computers on the network.  SNMP defines the\n   format for the data; it is left to the central station or network\n   manager to interpret the data.\n\n<span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.6\" href=\"#section-8.6\">8.6</a>  X-Window</h3></span>\n\n   The X Window System uses the X Window protocol on TCP to draw windows\n   on a workstation's bitmap display.  X Window is much more than a\n   utility for drawing windows; it is entire philosophy for designing a\n   user interface.\n\n<span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-9\" href=\"#section-9\">9</a>.

Introduction</h2></span> This tutorial contains only one view of the salient points of TCP/IP, and therefore it is the \"bare bones\" of TCP/IP technology. It omits the history of development and funding, the business case for its use, and its future as compared to ISO OSI. Indeed, a great deal of technical information is also omitted. What remains is a minimum of information that must be understood by the professional working in a TCP/IP environment. These professionals include the systems administrator, the systems programmer, and the network manager. This tutorial uses examples from the UNIX TCP/IP environment, however the main points apply across all implementations of TCP/IP. Note that the purpose of this memo is explanation, not definition. If any question arises about the correct specification of a protocol, please refer to the actual standards defining RFC. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 1]</span> <a name=\"page-2\" id=\"page-2\" href=\"#page-2\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> The next section is an overview of TCP/IP, followed by detailed descriptions of individual components. <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2\" href=\"#section-2\">2</a>. TCP/IP Overview</h2></span> The generic term \"TCP/IP\" usually means anything and everything related to the specific protocols of TCP and IP. It can include other protocols, applications, and even the network medium. A sample of these protocols are: UDP, ARP, and ICMP. A sample of these applications are: TELNET, FTP, and rcp. A more accurate term is \"internet technology\". A network that uses internet technology is called an \"internet\". <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.1\" href=\"#section-2.1\">2.1</a> Basic Structure</h3></span> To understand this technology you must first understand the following logical structure: ---------------------------- | network applications | | | |... \\ | / .. \\ | / ...| | ----- ----- | | |TCP| |UDP| | | ----- ----- | | \\ / | | -------- | | | IP | | | ----- -*------ | | |ARP| | | | ----- | | | \\ | | | ------ | | |ENET| | | ---@-- | ----------|----------------- | ----------------------o--------- Ethernet Cable Figure 1. Basic TCP/IP Network Node This is the logical structure of the layered protocols inside a computer on an internet. Each computer that can communicate using internet technology has such a logical structure. It is this logical structure that determines the behavior of the computer on the internet. The boxes represent processing of the data as it passes through the computer, and the lines connecting boxes show the path of <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 2]</span> <a name=\"page-3\" id=\"page-3\" href=\"#page-3\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> data. The horizontal line at the bottom represents the Ethernet cable; the \"o\" is the transceiver. The \"*\" is the IP address and the \"@\" is the Ethernet address. Understanding this logical structure is essential to understanding internet technology; it is referred to throughout this tutorial. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.2\" href=\"#section-2.2\">2.2</a> Terminology</h3></span> The name of a unit of data that flows through an internet is dependent upon where it exists in the protocol stack. In summary: if it is on an Ethernet it is called an Ethernet frame; if it is between the Ethernet driver and the IP module it is called a IP packet; if it is between the IP module and the UDP module it is called a UDP datagram; if it is between the IP module and the TCP module it is called a TCP segment (more generally, a transport message); and if it is in a network application it is called a application message. These definitions are imperfect. Actual definitions vary from one publication to the next. More specific definitions can be found in <a href=\"./rfc1122#section-1.3.3\">RFC 1122, section&nbsp;1.3.3</a>. A driver is software that communicates directly with the network interface hardware. A module is software that communicates with a driver, with network applications, or with another module. The terms driver, module, Ethernet frame, IP packet, UDP datagram, TCP message, and application message are used where appropriate throughout this tutorial. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.3\" href=\"#section-2.3\">2.3</a> Flow of Data</h3></span> Let's follow the data as it flows down through the protocol stack shown in Figure 1. For an application that uses TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), data passes between the application and the TCP module. For applications that use UDP (User Datagram Protocol), data passes between the application and the UDP module. FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a typical application that uses TCP. Its protocol stack in this example is FTP/TCP/IP/ENET. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is an application that uses UDP. Its protocol stack in this example is SNMP/UDP/IP/ENET. The TCP module, UDP module, and the Ethernet driver are n-to-1 multiplexers. As multiplexers they switch many inputs to one output. They are also 1-to-n de-multiplexers. As de-multiplexers they switch one input to many outputs according to the type field in the protocol header. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 3]</span> <a name=\"page-4\" id=\"page-4\" href=\"#page-4\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> 1 2 3 ... n 1 2 3 ... n \\ | / | \\ | | / ^ \\ | | / | \\ | | / | ------------- flow ---------------- flow |multiplexer| of |de-multiplexer| of ------------- data ---------------- data | | | | | v | | 1 1 Figure 2. n-to-1 multiplexer and 1-to-n de-multiplexer If an Ethernet frame comes up into the Ethernet driver off the network, the packet can be passed upwards to either the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) module or to the IP (Internet Protocol) module. The value of the type field in the Ethernet frame determines whether the Ethernet frame is passed to the ARP or the IP module. If an IP packet comes up into IP, the unit of data is passed upwards to either TCP or UDP, as determined by the value of the protocol field in the IP header. If the UDP datagram comes up into UDP, the application message is passed upwards to the network application based on the value of the port field in the UDP header. If the TCP message comes up into TCP, the application message is passed upwards to the network application based on the value of the port field in the TCP header. The downwards multiplexing is simple to perform because from each starting point there is only the one downward path; each protocol module adds its header information so the packet can be de- multiplexed at the destination computer. Data passing out from the applications through either TCP or UDP converges on the IP module and is sent downwards through the lower network interface driver. Although internet technology supports many different network media, Ethernet is used for all examples in this tutorial because it is the most common physical network used under IP. The computer in Figure 1 has a single Ethernet connection. The 6-byte Ethernet address is unique for each interface on an Ethernet and is located at the lower interface of the Ethernet driver. The computer also has a 4-byte IP address. This address is located at the lower interface to the IP module.

Example of IP Forwarding a IP Packet The process of sending an IP packet out onto another network is called \"forwarding\" an IP packet. A computer that has been dedicated to the task of forwarding IP packets is called an \"IP-router\". As you can see from the figure, the forwarded IP packet never touches the TCP and UDP modules on the IP-router.

Each module or driver strips the corresponding header from the message as the message climbs the protocol stack up towards the application. The IP header contains the IP address, which builds a single logical network from multiple physical networks. This interconnection of physical networks is the source of the name: internet. A set of interconnected physical networks that limit the range of an IP packet is called an \"internet\". <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.6\" href=\"#section-2.6\">2.6</a> Physical Network Independence</h3></span> IP hides the underlying network hardware from the network applications. If you invent a new physical network, you can put it into service by implementing a new driver that connects to the internet underneath IP.

Users of general-purpose computers benefit from the installation of an internet because of the interoperability in computers on the market. Generally, when you buy a computer, it will interoperate. If the computer does not have interoperability, and interoperability can not be added, it occupies a rare and special niche in the market. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-2.8\" href=\"#section-2.8\">2.8</a> After the Overview</h3></span> With the background set, we will answer the following questions: When sending out an IP packet, how is the destination Ethernet address determined? How does IP know which of multiple lower network interfaces to use when sending out an IP packet? How does a client on one computer reach the server on another? Why do both TCP and UDP exist, instead of just one or the other? What network applications are available?

Ethernet</h2></span> This section is a short review of Ethernet technology. An Ethernet frame contains the destination address, source address, type field, and data. An Ethernet address is 6 bytes. Every device has its own Ethernet address and listens for Ethernet frames with that destination address. All devices also listen for Ethernet frames with a wild- card destination address of \"FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF\" (in hexadecimal), called a \"broadcast\" address. Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense and Multiple Access with Collision Detection). CSMA/CD means that all devices communicate on a single medium, that only one can transmit at a time, and that they can all receive simultaneously. If 2 devices try to transmit at the same instant, the transmit collision is detected, and both devices wait a random (but short) period before trying to transmit again. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-3.1\" href=\"#section-3.1\">3.1</a> A Human Analogy</h3></span> A good analogy of Ethernet technology is a group of people talking in a small, completely dark room. In this analogy, the physical network medium is sound waves on air in the room instead of electrical signals on a coaxial cable. Each person can hear the words when another is talking (Carrier Sense). Everyone in the room has equal capability to talk (Multiple Access), but none of them give lengthy speeches because they are polite. If a person is impolite, he is asked to leave the room (i.e., thrown off the net). No one talks while another is speaking. But if two people start speaking at the same instant, each of them know this because each hears something they haven't said (Collision Detection). When these two people notice this condition, they wait for a moment, then one begins talking. The other hears the talking and waits for the first to finish before beginning his own speech. Each person has an unique name (unique Ethernet address) to avoid confusion. Every time one of them talks, he prefaces the message with the name of the person he is talking to and with his own name (Ethernet destination and source address, respectively), i.e., \"Hello Jane, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah...\". If the sender wants to talk to everyone he might say \"everyone\" (broadcast address), i.e., \"Hello Everyone, this is Jack, ..blah blah blah...\". <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 8]</span> <a name=\"page-9\" id=\"page-9\" href=\"#page-9\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-4\" href=\"#section-4\">4</a>. ARP</h2></span> When sending out an IP packet, how is the destination Ethernet address determined? ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is used to translate IP addresses to Ethernet addresses. The translation is done only for outgoing IP packets, because this is when the IP header and the Ethernet header are created. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-4.1\" href=\"#section-4.1\">4.1</a> ARP Table for Address Translation</h3></span> The translation is performed with a table look-up. The table, called the ARP table, is stored in memory and contains a row for each computer. There is a column for IP address and a column for Ethernet address. When translating an IP address to an Ethernet address, the table is searched for a matching IP address. The following is a simplified ARP table: ------------------------------------ |IP address Ethernet address | ------------------------------------ |223.1.2.1 08-00-39-00-2F-C3| |223.1.2.3 08-00-5A-21-A7-22| |223.1.2.4 08-00-10-99-AC-54| ------------------------------------ TABLE 1. Example ARP Table The human convention when writing out the 4-byte IP address is each byte in decimal and separating bytes with a period. When writing out the 6-byte Ethernet address, the conventions are each byte in hexadecimal and separating bytes with either a minus sign or a colon. The ARP table is necessary because the IP address and Ethernet address are selected independently; you can not use an algorithm to translate IP address to Ethernet address. The IP address is selected by the network manager based on the location of the computer on the internet. When the computer is moved to a different part of an internet, its IP address must be changed. The Ethernet address is selected by the manufacturer based on the Ethernet address space licensed by the manufacturer. When the Ethernet hardware interface board changes, the Ethernet address changes. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-4.2\" href=\"#section-4.2\">4.2</a> Typical Translation Scenario</h3></span> During normal operation a network application, such as TELNET, sends an application message to TCP, then TCP sends the corresponding TCP message to the IP module. The destination IP address is known by the <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 9]</span> <a name=\"page-10\" id=\"page-10\" href=\"#page-10\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> application, the TCP module, and the IP module. At this point the IP packet has been constructed and is ready to be given to the Ethernet driver, but first the destination Ethernet address must be determined. The ARP table is used to look-up the destination Ethernet address. 4.3 ARP Request/Response Pair But how does the ARP table get filled in the first place? The answer is that it is filled automatically by ARP on an \"as-needed\" basis. Two things happen when the ARP table can not be used to translate an address: 1. An ARP request packet with a broadcast Ethernet address is sent out on the network to every computer. 2. The outgoing IP packet is queued. Every computer's Ethernet interface receives the broadcast Ethernet frame. Each Ethernet driver examines the Type field in the Ethernet frame and passes the ARP packet to the ARP module. The ARP request packet says \"If your IP address matches this target IP address, then please tell me your Ethernet address\". An ARP request packet looks something like this: --------------------------------------- |Sender IP Address 223.1.2.1 | |Sender Enet Address 08-00-39-00-2F-C3| --------------------------------------- |Target IP Address 223.1.2.2 | |Target Enet Address &lt;blank&gt; | --------------------------------------- TABLE 2. Example ARP Request Each ARP module examines the IP address and if the Target IP address matches its own IP address, it sends a response directly to the source Ethernet address. The ARP response packet says \"Yes, that target IP address is mine, let me give you my Ethernet address\". An ARP response packet has the sender/target field contents swapped as compared to the request. It looks something like this: <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 10]</span> <a name=\"page-11\" id=\"page-11\" href=\"#page-11\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> --------------------------------------- |Sender IP Address 223.1.2.2 | |Sender Enet Address 08-00-28-00-38-A9| --------------------------------------- |Target IP Address 223.1.2.1 | |Target Enet Address 08-00-39-00-2F-C3| --------------------------------------- TABLE 3. Example ARP Response The response is received by the original sender computer. The Ethernet driver looks at the Type field in the Ethernet frame then passes the ARP packet to the ARP module. The ARP module examines the ARP packet and adds the sender's IP and Ethernet addresses to its ARP table. The updated table now looks like this: ---------------------------------- |IP address Ethernet address | ---------------------------------- |223.1.2.1 08-00-39-00-2F-C3| |223.1.2.2 08-00-28-00-38-A9| |223.1.2.3 08-00-5A-21-A7-22| |223.1.2.4 08-00-10-99-AC-54| ---------------------------------- TABLE 4. ARP Table after Response <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-4.4\" href=\"#section-4.4\">4.4</a> Scenario Continued</h3></span> The new translation has now been installed automatically in the table, just milli-seconds after it was needed. As you remember from step 2 above, the outgoing IP packet was queued. Next, the IP address to Ethernet address translation is performed by look-up in the ARP table then the Ethernet frame is transmitted on the Ethernet. Therefore, with the new steps 3, 4, and 5, the scenario for the sender computer is: 1. An ARP request packet with a broadcast Ethernet address is sent out on the network to every computer. 2. The outgoing IP packet is queued. 3. The ARP response arrives with the IP-to-Ethernet address translation for the ARP table. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 11]</span> <a name=\"page-12\" id=\"page-12\" href=\"#page-12\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> 4. For the queued IP packet, the ARP table is used to translate the IP address to the Ethernet address. 5. The Ethernet frame is transmitted on the Ethernet. In summary, when the translation is missing from the ARP table, one IP packet is queued. The translation data is quickly filled in with ARP request/response and the queued IP packet is transmitted. Each computer has a separate ARP table for each of its Ethernet interfaces. If the target computer does not exist, there will be no ARP response and no entry in the ARP table. IP will discard outgoing IP packets sent to that address. The upper layer protocols can't tell the difference between a broken Ethernet and the absence of a computer with the target IP address. Some implementations of IP and ARP don't queue the IP packet while waiting for the ARP response. Instead the IP packet is discarded and the recovery from the IP packet loss is left to the TCP module or the UDP network application. This recovery is performed by time-out and retransmission. The retransmitted message is successfully sent out onto the network because the first copy of the message has already caused the ARP table to be filled. <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5\" href=\"#section-5\">5</a>. Internet Protocol</h2></span> The IP module is central to internet technology and the essence of IP is its route table. IP uses this in-memory table to make all decisions about routing an IP packet. The content of the route table is defined by the network administrator. Mistakes block communication. To understand how a route table is used is to understand internetworking. This understanding is necessary for the successful administration and maintenance of an IP network. The route table is best understood by first having an overview of routing, then learning about IP network addresses, and then looking at the details. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.1\" href=\"#section-5.1\">5.1</a> Direct Routing</h3></span> The figure below is of a tiny internet with 3 computers: A, B, and C. Each computer has the same TCP/IP protocol stack as in Figure 1. Each computer's Ethernet interface has its own Ethernet address. Each computer has an IP address assigned to the IP interface by the network manager, who also has assigned an IP network number to the Ethernet. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 12]</span> <a name=\"page-13\" id=\"page-13\" href=\"#page-13\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> A B C | | | --o------o------o-- Ethernet 1 IP network \"development\" Figure 6. One IP Network When A sends an IP packet to B, the IP header contains A's IP address as the source IP address, and the Ethernet header contains A's Ethernet address as the source Ethernet address. Also, the IP header contains B's IP address as the destination IP address and the Ethernet header contains B's Ethernet address as the destination Ethernet address. ---------------------------------------- |address source destination| ---------------------------------------- |IP header A B | |Ethernet header A B | ---------------------------------------- TABLE 5. Addresses in an Ethernet frame for an IP packet from A to B For this simple case, IP is overhead because the IP adds little to the service offered by Ethernet. However, IP does add cost: the extra CPU processing and network bandwidth to generate, transmit, and parse the IP header. When B's IP module receives the IP packet from A, it checks the destination IP address against its own, looking for a match, then it passes the datagram to the upper-level protocol. This communication between A and B uses direct routing. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.2\" href=\"#section-5.2\">5.2</a> Indirect Routing</h3></span> The figure below is a more realistic view of an internet. It is composed of 3 Ethernets and 3 IP networks connected by an IP-router called computer D. Each IP network has 4 computers; each computer has its own IP address and Ethernet address. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 13]</span> <a name=\"page-14\" id=\"page-14\" href=\"#page-14\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> A B C ----D---- E F G | | | | | | | | | --o------o------o------o- | -o------o------o------o-- Ethernet 1 | Ethernet 2 IP network \"development\" | IP network \"accounting\" | | | H I J | | | | --o-----o------o------o-- Ethernet 3 IP network \"factory\" Figure 7. Three IP Networks; One internet Except for computer D, each computer has a TCP/IP protocol stack like that in Figure 1. Computer D is the IP-router; it is connected to all 3 networks and therefore has 3 IP addresses and 3 Ethernet addresses. Computer D has a TCP/IP protocol stack similar to that in Figure 3, except that it has 3 ARP modules and 3 Ethernet drivers instead of 2. Please note that computer D has only one IP module. The network manager has assigned a unique number, called an IP network number, to each of the Ethernets. The IP network numbers are not shown in this diagram, just the network names. When computer A sends an IP packet to computer B, the process is identical to the single network example above. Any communication between computers located on a single IP network matches the direct routing example discussed previously. When computer D and A communicate, it is direct communication. When computer D and E communicate, it is direct communication. When computer D and H communicate, it is direct communication. This is because each of these pairs of computers is on the same IP network. However, when computer A communicates with a computer on the far side of the IP-router, communication is no longer direct. A must use D to forward the IP packet to the next IP network. This communication is called \"indirect\". This routing of IP packets is done by IP modules and happens transparently to TCP, UDP, and the network applications. If A sends an IP packet to E, the source IP address and the source Ethernet address are A's. The destination IP address is E's, but because A's IP module sends the IP packet to D for forwarding, the destination Ethernet address is D's. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 14]</span> <a name=\"page-15\" id=\"page-15\" href=\"#page-15\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> ---------------------------------------- |address source destination| ---------------------------------------- |IP header A E | |Ethernet header A D | ---------------------------------------- TABLE 6.

Addresses in an Ethernet frame for an IP packet from A to E (after D) In summary, for direct communication, both the source IP address and the source Ethernet address is the sender's, and the destination IP address and the destination Ethernet address is the recipient's. For indirect communication, the IP address and Ethernet addresses do not pair up in this way. This example internet is a very simple one. Real networks are often complicated by many factors, resulting in multiple IP-routers and several types of physical networks. This example internet might have come about because the network manager wanted to split a large Ethernet in order to localize Ethernet broadcast traffic. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.3\" href=\"#section-5.3\">5.3</a> IP Module Routing Rules</h3></span> This overview of routing has shown what happens, but not how it happens. Now let's examine the rules, or algorithm, used by the IP module. For an outgoing IP packet, entering IP from an upper layer, IP must decide whether to send the IP packet directly or indirectly, and IP must choose a lower network interface. These choices are made by consulting the route table. For an incoming IP packet, entering IP from a lower interface, IP must decide whether to forward the IP packet or pass it to an upper layer. If the IP packet is being forwarded, it is treated as an <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 15]</span> <a name=\"page-16\" id=\"page-16\" href=\"#page-16\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> outgoing IP packet. When an incoming IP packet arrives it is never forwarded back out through the same network interface. These decisions are made before the IP packet is handed to the lower interface and before the ARP table is consulted. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.4\" href=\"#section-5.4\">5.4</a> IP Address</h3></span> The network manager assigns IP addresses to computers according to the IP network to which the computer is attached. One part of a 4- byte IP address is the IP network number, the other part is the IP computer number (or host number). For the computer in table 1, with an IP address of 223.1.2.1, the network number is 223.1.2 and the host number is number 1. The portion of the address that is used for network number and for host number is defined by the upper bits in the 4-byte address. All example IP addresses in this tutorial are of type class C, meaning that the upper 3 bits indicate that 21 bits are the network number and 8 bits are the host number. This allows 2,097,152 class C networks up to 254 hosts on each network. The IP address space is administered by the NIC (Network Information Center). All internets that are connected to the single world-wide Internet must use network numbers assigned by the NIC. If you are setting up your own internet and you are not intending to connect it to the Internet, you should still obtain your network numbers from the NIC. If you pick your own number, you run the risk of confusion and chaos in the eventuality that your internet is connected to another internet. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.5\" href=\"#section-5.5\">5.5</a> Names</h3></span> People refer to computers by names, not numbers. A computer called alpha might have the IP address of 223.1.2.1. For small networks, this name-to-address translation data is often kept on each computer in the \"hosts\" file. For larger networks, this translation data file is stored on a server and accessed across the network when needed. A few lines from that file might look like this: 223.1.2.1 alpha 223.1.2.2 beta 223.1.2.3 gamma 223.1.2.4 delta 223.1.3.2 epsilon 223.1.4.2 iota <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 16]</span> <a name=\"page-17\" id=\"page-17\" href=\"#page-17\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> The IP address is the first column and the computer name is the second column. In most cases, you can install identical \"hosts\" files on all computers. You may notice that \"delta\" has only one entry in this file even though it has 3 IP addresses. Delta can be reached with any of its IP addresses; it does not matter which one is used. When delta receives an IP packet and looks at the destination address, it will recognize any of its own IP addresses. IP networks are also given names. If you have 3 IP networks, your \"networks\" file for documenting these names might look something like this: 223.1.2 development 223.1.3 accounting 223.1.4 factory The IP network number is in the first column and its name is in the second column. From this example you can see that alpha is computer number 1 on the development network, beta is computer number 2 on the development network and so on. You might also say that alpha is development.1, Beta is development.2, and so on. The above hosts file is adequate for the users, but the network manager will probably replace the line for delta with: 223.1.2.4 devnetrouter delta 223.1.3.1 facnetrouter 223.1.4.1 accnetrouter These three new lines for the hosts file give each of delta's IP addresses a meaningful name. In fact, the first IP address listed has 2 names; \"delta\" and \"devnetrouter\" are synonyms. In practice \"delta\" is the general-purpose name of the computer and the other 3 names are only used when administering the IP route table. These files are used by network administration commands and network applications to provide meaningful names. They are not required for operation of an internet, but they do make it easier for us. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.6\" href=\"#section-5.6\">5.6</a> IP Route Table</h3></span> How does IP know which lower network interface to use when sending out a IP packet?

The route table contains one row for each route. The primary columns in the route table are: IP network number, direct/indirect flag, router IP address, and interface number.

The IP packet is in alpha's IP module and the destination IP address is beta or 223.1.2.2. IP extracts the network portion of this IP address and scans the first column of the table looking for a match. With this network a match is found on the first entry. The other information in this entry indicates that computers on this network can be reached directly through interface number 1. An ARP table translation is done on beta's IP address then the Ethernet frame is sent directly to beta via interface number 1. If an application tries to send data to an IP address that is not on the development network, IP will be unable to find a match in the route table. IP then discards the IP packet. Some computers provide a \"Network not reachable\" error message. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.9\" href=\"#section-5.9\">5.9</a> Indirect Routing Details</h3></span> Now, let's take a closer look at the more complicated routing scenario that we examined previously. <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 19]</span> <a name=\"page-20\" id=\"page-20\" href=\"#page-20\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> --------- --------- --------- | alpha | | delta | |epsilon| | 1 | |1 2 3| | 1 | --------- --------- --------- | | | | | --------o---------------o- | -o----------------o-------- Ethernet 1 | Ethernet 2 IP network \"Development\" | IP network \"accounting\" | | -------- | | iota | | | 1 | | -------- | | --o--------o-------- Ethernet 3 IP network \"factory\" Figure 9.

The IP packet is in alpha's IP module and the destination IP address is epsilon (223.1.3.2). IP extracts the network portion of this IP address (223.1.3) and scans the first column of the table looking for a match. A match is found on the second entry. This entry indicates that computers on the 223.1.3 network can be reached through the IP-router devnetrouter. Alpha's IP module then does an ARP table translation for devnetrouter's IP address and sends the IP packet directly to devnetrouter through Alpha's interface number 1. The IP packet still contains the destination address of epsilon. The IP packet arrives at delta's development network interface and is passed up to delta's IP module. The destination IP address is examined and because it does not match any of delta's own IP addresses, delta decides to forward the IP packet. Delta's IP module extracts the network portion of the destination IP address (223.1.3) and scans its route table for a matching network field. Delta's route table looks like this: ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |network direct/indirect flag router interface number| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |development direct &lt;blank&gt; 1 | |factory direct &lt;blank&gt; 3 | |accounting direct &lt;blank&gt; 2 | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TABLE 12.

The IP packet arrives at epsilon and is passed up to epsilon's IP module. The destination IP address is examined and found to match with epsilon's IP address, so the IP packet is passed to the upper protocol layer. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.11\" href=\"#section-5.11\">5.11</a> Routing Summary</h3></span> When a IP packet travels through a large internet it may go through many IP-routers before it reaches its destination. The path it takes is not determined by a central source but is a result of consulting each of the routing tables used in the journey. Each computer defines only the next hop in the journey and relies on that computer to send the IP packet on its way. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-5.12\" href=\"#section-5.12\">5.12</a> Managing the Routes</h3></span> Maintaining correct routing tables on all computers in a large internet is a difficult task; network configuration is being modified constantly by the network managers to meet changing needs. Mistakes in routing tables can block communication in ways that are excruciatingly tedious to diagnose. Keeping a simple network configuration goes a long way towards making a reliable internet. For instance, the most straightforward method of assigning IP networks to Ethernet is to assign a single IP network number to each Ethernet. Help is also available from certain protocols and network applications. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) can report some routing problems. For small networks the route table is filled manually on each computer by the network administrator. For larger networks the network administrator automates this manual operation with a routing protocol to distribute routes throughout a network. When a computer is moved from one IP network to another, its IP address must change. When a computer is removed from an IP network its old address becomes invalid. These changes require frequent updates to the \"hosts\" file. This flat file can become difficult to maintain for even medium-size networks. The Domain Name System helps solve these problems. <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-6\" href=\"#section-6\">6</a>. User Datagram Protocol</h2></span> UDP is one of the two main protocols to reside on top of IP. It offers service to the user's network applications. Example network applications that use UDP are: Network File System (NFS) and Simple <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 22]</span> <a name=\"page-23\" id=\"page-23\" href=\"#page-23\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> Network Management Protocol (SNMP). The service is little more than an interface to IP. UDP is a connectionless datagram delivery service that does not guarantee delivery. UDP does not maintain an end-to-end connection with the remote UDP module; it merely pushes the datagram out on the net and accepts incoming datagrams off the net. UDP adds two values to what is provided by IP. One is the multiplexing of information between applications based on port number. The other is a checksum to check the integrity of the data. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-6.1\" href=\"#section-6.1\">6.1</a> Ports</h3></span> How does a client on one computer reach the server on another? The path of communication between an application and UDP is through UDP ports. These ports are numbered, beginning with zero. An application that is offering service (the server) waits for messages to come in on a specific port dedicated to that service. The server waits patiently for any client to request service. For instance, the SNMP server, called an SNMP agent, always waits on port 161. There can be only one SNMP agent per computer because there is only one UDP port number 161. This port number is well known; it is a fixed number, an internet assigned number. If an SNMP client wants service, it sends its request to port number 161 of UDP on the destination computer. When an application sends data out through UDP it arrives at the far end as a single unit. For example, if an application does 5 writes to the UDP port, the application at the far end will do 5 reads from the UDP port. Also, the size of each write matches the size of each read. UDP preserves the message boundary defined by the application. It never joins two application messages together, or divides a single application message into parts. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-6.2\" href=\"#section-6.2\">6.2</a> Checksum</h3></span> An incoming IP packet with an IP header type field indicating \"UDP\" is passed up to the UDP module by IP. When the UDP module receives the UDP datagram from IP it examines the UDP checksum. If the checksum is zero, it means that checksum was not calculated by the sender and can be ignored. Thus the sending computer's UDP module may or may not generate checksums. If Ethernet is the only network between the 2 UDP modules communicating, then you may not need <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 23]</span> <a name=\"page-24\" id=\"page-24\" href=\"#page-24\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> checksumming. However, it is recommended that checksum generation always be enabled because at some point in the future a route table change may send the data across less reliable media. If the checksum is valid (or zero), the destination port number is examined and if an application is bound to that port, an application message is queued for the application to read. Otherwise the UDP datagram is discarded. If the incoming UDP datagrams arrive faster than the application can read them and if the queue fills to a maximum value, UDP datagrams are discarded by UDP. UDP will continue to discard UDP datagrams until there is space in the queue. <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-7\" href=\"#section-7\">7</a>. Transmission Control Protocol</h2></span> TCP provides a different service than UDP. TCP offers a connection- oriented byte stream, instead of a connectionless datagram delivery service. TCP guarantees delivery, whereas UDP does not. TCP is used by network applications that require guaranteed delivery and cannot be bothered with doing time-outs and retransmissions. The two most typical network applications that use TCP are File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and the TELNET. Other popular TCP network applications include X-Window System, rcp (remote copy), and the r- series commands. TCP's greater capability is not without cost: it requires more CPU and network bandwidth. The internals of the TCP module are much more complicated than those in a UDP module. Similar to UDP, network applications connect to TCP ports. Well- defined port numbers are dedicated to specific applications. For instance, the TELNET server uses port number 23. The TELNET client can find the server simply by connecting to port 23 of TCP on the specified computer. When the application first starts using TCP, the TCP module on the client's computer and the TCP module on the server's computer start communicating with each other. These two end-point TCP modules contain state information that defines a virtual circuit. This virtual circuit consumes resources in both TCP end-points. The virtual circuit is full duplex; data can go in both directions simultaneously. The application writes data to the TCP port, the data traverses the network and is read by the application at the far end. TCP packetizes the byte stream at will; it does not retain the boundaries between writes. For example, if an application does 5 writes to the TCP port, the application at the far end might do 10 reads to get all the data. Or it might get all the data with a single read. There is no correlation between the number and size of <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 24]</span> <a name=\"page-25\" id=\"page-25\" href=\"#page-25\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> writes at one end to the number and size of reads at the other end. TCP is a sliding window protocol with time-out and retransmits. Outgoing data must be acknowledged by the far-end TCP. Acknowledgements can be piggybacked on data. Both receiving ends can flow control the far end, thus preventing a buffer overrun. As with all sliding window protocols, the protocol has a window size. The window size determines the amount of data that can be transmitted before an acknowledgement is required. For TCP, this amount is not a number of TCP segments but a number of bytes. <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8\" href=\"#section-8\">8</a>. Network Applications</h2></span> Why do both TCP and UDP exist, instead of just one or the other? They supply different services. Most applications are implemented to use only one or the other. You, the programmer, choose the protocol that best meets your needs. If you need a reliable stream delivery service, TCP might be best. If you need a datagram service, UDP might be best. If you need efficiency over long-haul circuits, TCP might be best. If you need efficiency over fast networks with short latency, UDP might be best. If your needs do not fall nicely into these categories, then the \"best\" choice is unclear. However, applications can make up for deficiencies in the choice. For instance if you choose UDP and you need reliability, then the application must provide reliability. If you choose TCP and you need a record oriented service, then the application must insert markers in the byte stream to delimit records. What network applications are available? There are far too many to list. The number is growing continually. Some of the applications have existed since the beginning of internet technology: TELNET and FTP. Others are relatively new: X-Windows and SNMP. The following is a brief description of the applications mentioned in this tutorial. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.1\" href=\"#section-8.1\">8.1</a> TELNET</h3></span> TELNET provides a remote login capability on TCP. The operation and appearance is similar to keyboard dialing through a telephone switch. On the command line the user types \"telnet delta\" and receives a login prompt from the computer called \"delta\". TELNET works well; it is an old application and has widespread interoperability. Implementations of TELNET usually work between different operating systems. For instance, a TELNET client may be on <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 25]</span> <a name=\"page-26\" id=\"page-26\" href=\"#page-26\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> VAX/VMS and the server on UNIX System V. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.2\" href=\"#section-8.2\">8.2</a> FTP</h3></span> File Transfer Protocol (FTP), as old as TELNET, also uses TCP and has widespread interoperability. The operation and appearance is as if you TELNETed to the remote computer. But instead of typing your usual commands, you have to make do with a short list of commands for directory listings and the like. FTP commands allow you to copy files between computers. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.3\" href=\"#section-8.3\">8.3</a> rsh</h3></span> Remote shell (rsh or remsh) is one of an entire family of remote UNIX style commands. The UNIX copy command, cp, becomes rcp. The UNIX \"who is logged in\" command, who, becomes rwho. The list continues and is referred to collectively to as the \"r\" series commands or the \"r*\" (r star) commands. The r* commands mainly work between UNIX systems and are designed for interaction between trusted hosts. Little consideration is given to security, but they provide a convenient user environment. To execute the \"cc file.c\" command on a remote computer called delta, type \"rsh delta cc file.c\". To copy the \"file.c\" file to delta, type \"rcp file.c delta:\". To login to delta, type \"rlogin delta\", and if you administered the computers in a certain way, you will not be challenged with a password prompt. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.4\" href=\"#section-8.4\">8.4</a> NFS</h3></span> Network File System, first developed by Sun Microsystems Inc, uses UDP and is excellent for mounting UNIX file systems on multiple computers. A diskless workstation can access its server's hard disk as if the disk were local to the workstation. A single disk copy of a database on mainframe \"alpha\" can also be used by mainframe \"beta\" if the database's file system is NFS mounted on \"beta\". NFS adds significant load to a network and has poor utility across slow links, but the benefits are strong. The NFS client is implemented in the kernel, allowing all applications and commands to use the NFS mounted disk as if it were local disk. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.5\" href=\"#section-8.5\">8.5</a> SNMP</h3></span> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) uses UDP and is designed for use by central network management stations. It is a well known fact that if given enough data, a network manager can detect and <span class=\"grey\">Socolofsky &amp; Kale [Page 26]</span> <a name=\"page-27\" id=\"page-27\" href=\"#page-27\" class=\"invisible\"> </a>\n<span class=\"grey\"><a href=\"./rfc1180\">RFC 1180</a> A TCP/IP Tutorial January 1991</span> diagnose network problems. The central station uses SNMP to collect this data from other computers on the network. SNMP defines the format for the data; it is left to the central station or network manager to interpret the data. <span class=\"h3\"><h3><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-8.6\" href=\"#section-8.6\">8.6</a> X-Window</h3></span> The X Window System uses the X Window protocol on TCP to draw windows on a workstation's bitmap display. X Window is much more than a utility for drawing windows; it is entire philosophy for designing a user interface. <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-9\" href=\"#section-9\">9</a>.

This section lists information that is considered the next level of detail for the reader who wishes to learn more. o administration commands: arp, route, and netstat o ARP: permanent entry, publish entry, time-out entry, spoofing o IP route table: host entry, default gateway, subnets o IP: time-to-live counter, fragmentation, ICMP o RIP, routing loops o Domain Name System <span class=\"h2\"><h2><a class=\"selflink\" name=\"section-10\" href=\"#section-10\">10</a>.

childhood playing emulated NES and SNES games on my computer, but I never imagined I'd write an emulator myself one day. However, my boyfriend Vanya challenged me to write a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8\">Chip-8</a> interpreter to learn some of the basic concepts of lower-level programming languages and how a CPU works, and the end result is a Chip-8 emulator in JavaScript that I wrote with his guidance.</p>\n<p>Although there are endless implementations of the Chip-8 interpreter in every programming language imaginable, this one is a bit unique. My Chip8.js code interfaces with not just one but three environments, existing as a web app, a CLI app, and a native app.</p>\n<p>You can take a look at the web app demo and the source here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://taniarascia.github.io/chip8/\">Demo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/chip8\">Source code</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are plenty of guides on how to make a Chip-8 emulator, such as <a href=\"http://mattmik.com/files/chip8/mastering/chip8.html\">Mastering Chip8</a>, <a href=\"http://www.multigesture.net/articles/how-to-write-an-emulator-Chip-8-interpreter/\">How to Write an Emulator</a>, and most importantly, <a href=\"http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM\">Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference</a>, the primary resource used for my own emulator, and a website so old it ends in <code class=\"language-text\">.HTM</code>. As such, this isn't intended to be a how-to guide, but an overview of how I built the emulator, what major concepts I learned, and some JavaScript specifics for making a browser, CLI, or native app.</p>\n<p><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative;

Chip-8 is a very simple interpreted programming language that was developed in the 1970s for hobbyist computers. People wrote basic Chip-8 programs that mimicked popular games of the time, such as Pong, Tetris, Space Invaders, and probably other unique games lost to the annuls of time.</p>\n<p>A virtual machine that plays these games is actually a Chip-8 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)\"><em>interpreter</em></a>, not technically an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator\"><em>emulator</em></a>, as an emulator is software that emulates the hardware of a specific machine, and Chip-8 programs aren't tied to any hardware in specific. Often, Chip-8 interpreters were used on graphing calculators.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it's close enough to being an emulator that it's usually the starting project for anyone who wants to learn how to build an emulator, since it's significantly more simple than creating an NES emulator or anything beyond that. It's also a good starting point for a lot of CPU concepts in general, like memory, stacks, and I/O, things I deal with on a daily basis in the infinitely more complex world of a JavaScript runtime.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-goes-into-a-chip-8-interpreter\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-goes-into-a-chip-8-interpreter\" aria-label=\"what goes into a chip 8 interpreter permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What Goes Into a Chip-8 Interpreter?</h2>\n<p>There was a lot of pre-learning I had to do to even get started understanding what I was working with, since I had never learned about computer science basics before. So I wrote <a href=\"https://www.taniarascia.com/bits-bytes-bases-and-a-hex-dump-javascript/\">Understanding Bits, Bytes, Bases, and Writing a Hex Dump in JavaScript</a> which goes over much of that.</p>\n<p>To summarize, there are two major takeaways of that article:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bits and Bytes</strong> - A bit is a binary digit - <code class=\"language-text\">0</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">1</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">true</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">false</code>, on or off. Eight bits is a byte, which is the basic unit of information that computers work with.</li>\n<li><strong>Number Bases</strong> - Decimal is the base number system we're most used to dealing with, but computers usually work with binary (base 2) or hexadecimal (base 16). <code class=\"language-text\">1111</code> in binary, <code class=\"language-text\">15</code> in decimal, and <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> in hexadecimal are all the same number.</li>\n<li><strong>Nibbles</strong> - Also, 4 bits is a nibble, which is cute, and I had to deal with them a bit in this project.</li>\n<li><strong>Prefixes</strong> - In JavaScript, <code class=\"language-text\">0x</code> is a prefix for a hex number, and <code class=\"language-text\">0b</code> is a prefix for a binary number.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I also wrote <a href=\"https://www.taniarascia.com/snake-game-in-javascript/\">a CLI snake game</a> in preparation of figuring out how to work with pixels in the terminal for this project.</p>\n<p>A <strong>CPU</strong> is the main processor of a computer that executes the instructions of a program. In this case, it consists of various bits of state, described below, and an instruction cycle with <strong>fetch, decode, and execute</strong> steps.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#memory\">Memory</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#program-counter\">Program counter</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#registers\">Registers</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#index-register\">Index register</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#stack\">Stack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#stack-pointer\">Stack pointer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#key-input\">Key input</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#graphical-output\">Graphical output</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#timers\">Timers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"memory\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#memory\" aria-label=\"memory permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Memory</h3>\n<p>Chip-8 can access up to <strong>4 kilobytes of memory</strong> (RAM).

All the instructions <a href=\"http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#3.1\">are listed here</a>. All instructions are 2 bytes (16-bits) long. Each instruction is encoded by an opcode (operation code) and operand, the data being operated on.</p>\n<p>An example of an instruction could be like this operation on two variables:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">x = 1\ny = 2\n\nADD x, y</code></pre></div>\n<p>In which <code class=\"language-text\">ADD</code> is the <code class=\"language-text\">opcode</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">x</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">y</code> are the operands. This type of language is known as an assembly language. This instruction would map to:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> y</code></pre></div>\n<p>With this instruction set I'll have to store this data in 16-bits, so every instrution ends up being a number from <code class=\"language-text\">0x0000</code> to <code class=\"language-text\">0xffff</code>. Each digit position in these sets is a nibble (4-bit).</p>\n<p>So how can I get from <code class=\"language-text\">nnnn</code> to something like <code class=\"language-text\">ADD x, y</code>, that is a little more understandable? Well, I'll start by looking at one of the instructions from Chip-8, which is basically the same as the above example:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Instruction</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">8xy4</code></td>\n<td><code class=\"language-text\">ADD Vx, Vy</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>So what are we dealing with here? There's one keyword, <code class=\"language-text\">ADD</code>, and two arguments, <code class=\"language-text\">Vx</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Vy</code>, which we've established above are registers.</p>\n<p>There are several opcode mnemonics (which are like keywords), such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">ADD</code> (add)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">SUB</code> (subtract)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">JP</code> (jump)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">SKP</code> (skip)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">RET</code> (return)</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">LD</code> (load)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And there are several type of operand values, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address (<code class=\"language-text\">I</code>)</li>\n<li>Register (<code class=\"language-text\">Vx</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">Vy</code>)</li>\n<li>Constant (<code class=\"language-text\">N</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">NN</code> for nibble or byte)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The next step is to find a way to interpret the 16-bit opcode as these more understandable instructions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"bit-masking\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bit-masking\" aria-label=\"bit masking permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bit Masking</h3>\n<p>Each instruction contains a pattern that will always be the same, and variables that can change. For <code class=\"language-text\">8xy4</code>, the pattern is <code class=\"language-text\">8__4</code>. The two nibbles in the middle are the variables. By creating a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mask_(computing)\">bitmask</a> for that pattern, I can determine the instruction.</p>\n<p>To mask, you use the bitwise AND (<code class=\"language-text\">&amp;</code>) with a mask and match it to a pattern. So if the instruction <code class=\"language-text\">8124</code> came up, you would want to make sure the nibble in position 1 and 4 are on (passed through) and the nibble in position 2 and 3 are off (masked out). The mask then becomes <code class=\"language-text\">f00f</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> opcode <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x8124</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> mask <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0xf00f</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> pattern <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x8004</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> isMatch <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>opcode <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> mask<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> pattern <span class=\"token comment\">// true</span></code></pre></div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">  8124\n&amp;

The ROM is just binary data, and we're writing the program to interpret it. We can imagine the Chip8 CPU to be a virtual console, and a Chip-8 ROM to be a virtual game cartridge.</p>\n<p>The ROM buffer will take the raw binary file and translate it into 16-bit big endian words (a word is a unit of data consisting of a set amount of bits). This is where that <a href=\"/bits-bytes-bases-and-a-hex-dump-javascript/\">hex dump article</a> comes in handy. I'm collecting the binary data and converting it into blocks that I can use, in this case the 16-bit opcodes. Big endian means that the most significant byte will be first in the buffer, so when it encounters the two bytes <code class=\"language-text\">12 34</code>, it will create a <code class=\"language-text\">1234</code> 16-bit code. A little endian code would look like <code class=\"language-text\">3412</code>.</p>\n<div class=\"filename\">RomBuffer.js</div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">RomBuffer</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">/**\n   * @param {binary} fileContents ROM binary\n   */</span>\n  <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">fileContents</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Read the raw data buffer from the file</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> buffer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> fileContents\n\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// Create 16-bit big endian opcodes from the buffer</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The data returned from this buffer is the \"game\".</p>\n<p>The CPU will have a <code class=\"language-text\">load()</code> method - like loading a cartridge into a console - that will take the data from this buffer and place it into memory.

The CPU just needs to do something with it. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit#Operation\">instruction cycle</a> consists of three steps - fetch, decode, and execute.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fetch</strong> - Get the data stored in memory using the program counter</li>\n<li><strong>Decode</strong> - Disassemble the 16-bit opcode to get the decoded instruction and argument values</li>\n<li><strong>Execute</strong> - Perform the operation based on the decoded instruction and update the program counter</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's a condensed and simplified version of how load, fetch, decode, and execute work in the code. These CPU cycle methods are private and not exposed.</p>\n<p>The first step, <code class=\"language-text\">fetch</code>, will access the current opcode from memory.</p>\n<div class=\"filename\">Fetch</div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Get address value from memory</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">fetch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> memory<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token constant\">PC</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The next step, <code class=\"language-text\">decode</code>, will disassemble the opcode into the more understandable instruction set I created earlier.</p>\n<div class=\"filename\">Decode</div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Decode instruction</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">decode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">opcode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">disassemble</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>opcode<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The last step, <code class=\"language-text\">execute</code>, will consist of a switch with all 36 instructions as cases, and perform the relevant operation for the one it finds, then update the program counter so the next fetch cycle finds the next opcode.

CPU that's interpreting and executing instructions and updating all its own state, but I can't do anything with it yet. In order to play a game, you have to see it and be able to interact with it.</p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output\">input/output</a>, or I/O, comes in. I/O is the communication between the CPU and the outside world.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Input</strong> is data received by the CPU</li>\n<li><strong>Output</strong> is data sent from the CPU</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So for me, the input will be through the keyboard, and the output will be graphics onto the screen.</p>\n<p>I could just mix the I/O code in with the CPU directly, but then I would be tied to one environment. By creating a generic CPU interface to connect the I/O and the CPU, I can interface with any system.</p>\n<p>The first thing to do was look through the instructions and find any that have to do with I/O. A few examples of those instructions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">CLS</code> - Clear the screen</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">LD Vx, K</code> - Wait for a key press, store the value of the key in Vx.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">DRW Vx, Vy, nibble</code> - Display n-byte sprite starting at memory location I</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on that, we'll want the interface to have methods like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">clearDisplay()</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">waitKey()</code></li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">drawPixel()</code> (<code class=\"language-text\">drawSprite</code> would have been 1:1, but it ended up to be easier doing it pixel-by-pixel from the interface)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>JavaScript doesn't really have a concept of an abstract class as far as I could find, but I created one by making a class that could not itself be instantiated, with methods that can only be used from classes that extend it. Here are all the interface methods on the class:</p>\n<div class=\"filename\">CpuInterface.js</div>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code

It was more difficult to figure out because I had to do everything in the <code class=\"language-text\">IsKeyDown</code> method - there was a <code class=\"language-text\">GetKeyPressed</code> method, but it had side effects and caused problems. So instead of just waiting for a keypress like the other implementations, I had to loop through all keys and check if they were down, and append them to the key bitmask if so.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> keyDownIndices <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Run through all possible keys</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> nativeKeyMap<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> currentKey <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> nativeKeyMap<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// If key is already down, add index to key down map</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// This will also lift up any keys that aren't pressed</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">IsKeyDown</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>currentKey<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    keyDownIndices <span class=\"token operator\">|=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> i\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Set all pressed keys</span>\ncpu<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>interface<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">setKeys</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>keyDownIndices<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>That's it for the native implementation.

Once again, you can <a href=\"https://github.com/taniarascia/chip8\">check out the source</a> on GitHub. I learned a lot about lower level programming concepts and how a CPU operates, and also about the capabilities of JavaScript outside of a browser app or REST API server. I still have a few things left to do in this project, like attempt to make a (very) simple game, but the emulator is complete, and I'm proud to have finished it.</p></div></article><aside

Rascia\nAboutArticlesNewsletter\nWriting an Emulator in JavaScript (and Interfacing with Multiple UIs)\nApril 13th, 2020/Share/Edit ✏️\njavascriptnodeemulator\nI spent a good portion of my childhood playing emulated NES and SNES games on my computer, but I never imagined I'd write an emulator myself one day. However, my boyfriend Vanya challenged me to write a Chip-8 interpreter to learn some of the basic concepts of lower-level programming languages and how a CPU works, and the end result is a Chip-8 emulator in JavaScript that I wrote with his guidance.\nAlthough there are endless implementations of the Chip-8 interpreter in every programming language imaginable, this one is a bit unique. My Chip8.js code interfaces with not just one but three environments, existing as a web app, a CLI app, and a native app.\nYou can take a look at the web app demo and the source here:\nDemo\nSource code\nThere are plenty of guides on how to make a Chip-8 emulator, such as Mastering Chip8, How to Write an Emulator, and most importantly, Cowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference, the primary resource used for my own emulator, and a website so old it ends in .HTM. As such, this isn't intended to be a how-to guide, but an overview of how I built the emulator, what major concepts I learned, and some JavaScript specifics for making a browser, CLI, or native app.\nContents\nWhat is Chip-8\nWhat Goes Into a Chip-8 Interpreter?\nDecoding Chip-8 Instructions\nReading the ROM\nThe Instruction Cycle - Fetch, Decode, Execute\nCreating a CPU Interface for I/O\nCLI App - Interfacing with the Terminal\nWeb App - Interfacing with the Browser\nNative App - Interfacing with the Native Platform\nWhat is Chip-8?\nI had never heard of Chip-8 before embarking on this project, so I assume most people haven't either unless they're already into emulators. Chip-8 is a very simple interpreted programming language that was developed in the 1970s for hobbyist computers. People wrote basic Chip-8 programs that mimicked popular games of the time, such as Pong, Tetris, Space Invaders, and probably other unique games lost to the annuls of time.\nA virtual machine that plays these games is actually a Chip-8 interpreter, not technically an emulator, as an emulator is software that emulates the hardware of a specific machine, and Chip-8 programs aren't tied to any hardware in specific. Often, Chip-8 interpreters were used on graphing calculators.\nNonetheless, it's close enough to being an emulator that it's usually the starting project for anyone who wants to learn how to build an emulator, since it's significantly more simple than creating an NES emulator or anything beyond that. It's also a good starting point for a lot of CPU concepts in general, like memory, stacks, and I/O, things I deal with on a daily basis in the infinitely more complex world of a JavaScript runtime.\nWhat Goes Into a Chip-8 Interpreter?\nThere was a lot of pre-learning I had to do to even get started understanding what I was working with, since I had never learned about computer science basics before. So I wrote Understanding Bits, Bytes, Bases, and Writing a Hex Dump in JavaScript which goes over much of that.\nTo summarize, there are two major takeaways of that article:\nBits and Bytes - A bit is a binary digit - 0 or 1, true or false, on or off. Eight bits is a byte, which is the basic unit of information that computers work with.\nNumber Bases - Decimal is the base number system we're most used to dealing with, but computers usually work with binary (base 2) or hexadecimal (base 16). 1111 in binary, 15 in decimal, and f in hexadecimal are all the same number.\nNibbles - Also, 4 bits is a nibble, which is cute, and I had to deal with them a bit in this project.\nPrefixes - In JavaScript, 0x is a prefix for a hex number, and 0b is a prefix for a binary number.\nI also wrote a CLI snake game in preparation of figuring out how to work with pixels in the terminal for this project.\nA CPU is the main processor of a computer that executes the instructions of a program. In this case, it consists of various bits of state, described below, and an instruction cycle with fetch, decode, and execute steps.\nMemory\nProgram counter\nRegisters\nIndex register\nStack\nStack pointer\nKey input\nGraphical output\nTimers\nMemory\nChip-8 can access up to 4 kilobytes of memory (RAM). (That's 0.002% of the storage space on a floppy disk.) The vast majority of data in the CPU is stored in memory.\n4kb is 4096 bytes, and JavaScript has some helpful typed arrays, like Uint8Array which is a fixed-size array of a certain element - in this case 8-bits.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> memory <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint8Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4096</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code>\nYou can access and use this array like a regular array, from memory[0] to memory[4095] and set each element to a value up to 255. Anything above that will fall back to that (for example, memory[0] = 300 would result in memory[0] === 255).\nProgram counter\nThe program counter stores the address of the current instruction as an 16-bit integer. Every single instruction in Chip-8 will update the program counter (PC) when it is done to go on to the next instruction, by accessing memory with PC as the index.\nIn the Chip-8 memory layout, 0x000 to 0x1FF in memory is reserved, so it starts at 0x200.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token constant\">PC</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x200</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// memory[PC] will access the address of the current instruvtion</span></code>\n*You'll notice the memory array is 8-bit and the PC is a 16-bit integer, so two program codes will be combined to make a big endian opcode.\nRegisters\nMemory is generally used for long-term storage and program data, so registers exist as a kind of \"short-term memory\" for immediate data and computations. Chip-8 has 16 8-bit registers. They're referred as V0 through VF.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> registers <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint8Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code>\nIndex register\nThere is a special 16-bit register that accesses a specific point in memory, referred to as I. The I register exists mostly for reading and writing to memory in general, since the addressable memory is 16-bit as well.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token constant\">I</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span></code>\nStack\nChip-8 has the ability to go into subroutines, and a stack for keeping track of where to return to. The stack is 16 16-bit values, meaning the program can go into 16 nested subroutines before experiencing a \"stack overflow\".\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> stack <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint16Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code>\nStack pointer\nThe stack pointer (SP) is an 8-bit integer that points to a location in the stack. It only needs to be 8-bit even though the stack is 16-bit because it's only referencing the index of the stack, so only needs to be 0 thorough 15.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token constant\">SP</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// stack[SP] will access the current return address in the stack</span></code>\nTimers\nChip-8 is capable of a glorious single beep as far as sound goes. To be honest, I didn't bother implementing an actual output for the \"music\", though the CPU itself is all set up to interface properly with it. There are two timers, both 8-bit registers - a sound timer (ST) for deciding when to beep and a delay timer (DT) for timing some events throughout the game. They count down at 60 Hz.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token constant\">DT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> <span class=\"token constant\">ST</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span></code>\nKey input\nChip-8 was set up to interface with the amazing hex keyboard. It looked like this:\n<code class=\"language-terminal\">┌───┬───┬───┬───┐\n│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ C │\n│ 4 │ 5 │ 6 │ D │\n│ 7 │ 8 │ 9 │ E │\n│ A │ 0 │ B │ F │\n└───┴───┴───┴───┘</code>\nIn practice, only a few of the keys seem to be used, and you can map them to whatever 4x4 grid you want, but they're pretty inconsistent between games.\nGraphical output\nChip-8 uses a monochromatic 64x32 resolution display. Each pixel is either on or off.\nSprites that can be saved in memory are 8x15 - eight pixels wide by fifteen pixels high. Chip-8 also comes with a font set, but it only contains the characters in the hex keyboard, so not overall the most useful font set.\nCPU\nPut it all together, and you get the CPU state.\nCPU\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">CPU</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>memory <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint8Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">4096</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>registers <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint8Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>stack <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Uint16Array</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">16</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">ST</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">DT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">I</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">SP</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">PC</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x200</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nDecoding Chip-8 Instructions\nChip-8 has 36 instructions. All the instructions are listed here. All instructions are 2 bytes (16-bits) long. Each instruction is encoded by an opcode (operation code) and operand, the data being operated on.\nAn example of an instruction could be like this operation on two variables:\n<code class=\"language-text\">x = 1\ny = 2 ADD x, y</code>\nIn which ADD is the opcode and x, y are the operands. This type of language is known as an assembly language. This instruction would map to:\n<code class=\"language-js\">x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> y</code>\nWith this instruction set I'll have to store this data in 16-bits, so every instrution ends up being a number from 0x0000 to 0xffff. Each digit position in these sets is a nibble (4-bit).\nSo how can I get from nnnn to something like ADD x, y, that is a little more understandable? Well, I'll start by looking at one of the instructions from Chip-8, which is basically the same as the above example:\nInstruction Description\n8xy4\nADD Vx, Vy\nSo what are we dealing with here? There's one keyword, ADD, and two arguments, Vx and Vy, which we've established above are registers.\nThere are several opcode mnemonics (which are like keywords), such as:\nADD (add)\nSUB (subtract)\nJP (jump)\nSKP (skip)\nRET (return)\nLD (load)\nAnd there are several type of operand values, such as:\nAddress (I)\nRegister (Vx, Vy)\nConstant (N or NN for nibble or byte)\nThe next step is to find a way to interpret the 16-bit opcode as these more understandable instructions.\nBit Masking\nEach instruction contains a pattern that will always be the same, and variables that can change. For 8xy4, the pattern is 8__4. The two nibbles in the middle are the variables. By creating a bitmask for that pattern, I can determine the instruction.\nTo mask, you use the bitwise AND (&amp;) with a mask and match it to a pattern. So if the instruction 8124 came up, you would want to make sure the nibble in position 1 and 4 are on (passed through) and the nibble in position 2 and 3 are off (masked out). The mask then becomes f00f.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> opcode <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x8124</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> mask <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0xf00f</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> pattern <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x8004</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> isMatch <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>opcode <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> mask<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> pattern <span class=\"token comment\">// true</span></code>\n<code class=\"language-text\"> 8124\n&amp; f00f ==== 8004</code>\nSimilarly, 0f00 and 00f0 will mask the variables, and right-shifting (&gt;&gt;) them will access the correct nibble.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">0x8124</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x0f00</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// 1</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// (0x8124 &amp; 0x0f00) is 100000000 in binary</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// right shifting by 8 (&gt;&gt; 8) will remove 8 zeroes from the right</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// This leaves us with 1</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> y <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">0x8124</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x00f0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// 2</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// (0x8124 &amp; 0x00f0) is 100000 in binary</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// right shifting by 4 (&gt;&gt; 4) will remove 4 zeroes from the right</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// This leaves us with 10, the binary equivalent of 2</span></code>\nSo for each of the 36 instructions, I made an object with a unique identifier, mask, pattern, and arguments.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> instruction <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> id<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'ADD_VX_VY'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> name<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'ADD'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> mask<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">0xf00f</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> pattern<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x8004</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> arguments<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> mask<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x0f00</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> shift<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> type<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'R'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> mask<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">0x00f0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> shift<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> type<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'R'</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nNow that I have these objects, each opcode can be disassembled into a unique identifier, and the values of the arguments can be determined. I made an INSTRUCTION_SET array containing all these instructions and a disassembler. I also wrote tests for every one to ensure they all worked correctly.\nDisassembler\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">disassemble</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">opcode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Find the instruction from the opcode</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> instruction <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token constant\">INSTRUCTION_SET</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">find</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span> <span class=\"token parameter\">instruction</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>opcode <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> instruction<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>mask<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> instruction<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>pattern <span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Find the argument(s)</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> args <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> instruction<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>arguments<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">map</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">arg</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>opcode <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> arg<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>mask<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&gt;&gt;</span> arg<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>shift<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Return an object containing the instruction data and arguments</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> instruction<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> args <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nReading the ROM\nSince we're considering this project an emulator, each Chip-8 program file can be considered a ROM. The ROM is just binary data, and we're writing the program to interpret it. We can imagine the Chip8 CPU to be a virtual console, and a Chip-8 ROM to be a virtual game cartridge.\nThe ROM buffer will take the raw binary file and translate it into 16-bit big endian words (a word is a unit of data consisting of a set amount of bits). This is where that hex dump article comes in handy. I'm collecting the binary data and converting it into blocks that I can use, in this case the 16-bit opcodes. Big endian means that the most significant byte will be first in the buffer, so when it encounters the two bytes 12 34, it will create a 1234 16-bit code. A little endian code would look like 3412.\nRomBuffer.js\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">RomBuffer</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token comment\">/** * @param {binary} fileContents ROM binary */</span> <span class=\"token function\">constructor</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">fileContents</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Read the raw data buffer from the file</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> buffer <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> fileContents <span class=\"token comment\">// Create 16-bit big endian opcodes from the buffer</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">push</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">8</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">|</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>buffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nThe data returned from this buffer is the \"game\".\nThe CPU will have a load() method - like loading a cartridge into a console - that will take the data from this buffer and place it into memory. Both the buffer and memory act as arrays in JavaScript, so loading the memory is just a matter of looping through the buffer and placing the bytes into the memory array.\nThe Instruction Cycle - Fetch, Decode, Execute\nNow I have the instruction set and game data all ready to be interpreted. The CPU just needs to do something with it. The instruction cycle consists of three steps - fetch, decode, and execute.\nFetch - Get the data stored in memory using the program counter\nDecode - Disassemble the 16-bit opcode to get the decoded instruction and argument values\nExecute - Perform the operation based on the decoded instruction and update the program counter\nHere's a condensed and simplified version of how load, fetch, decode, and execute work in the code. These CPU cycle methods are private and not exposed.\nThe first step, fetch, will access the current opcode from memory.\nFetch\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Get address value from memory</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">fetch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> memory<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token constant\">PC</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nThe next step, decode, will disassemble the opcode into the more understandable instruction set I created earlier.\nDecode\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Decode instruction</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">decode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">opcode</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token function\">disassemble</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>opcode<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nThe last step, execute, will consist of a switch with all 36 instructions as cases, and perform the relevant operation for the one it finds, then update the program counter so the next fetch cycle finds the next opcode. Any error handling will go here as well, which will halt the CPU.\nExecute\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Execute instruction</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">execute</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">instruction</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> id<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> args <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> instruction <span class=\"token keyword\">switch</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>id<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token string\">'ADD_VX_VY'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Perform the instruction operation</span> registers<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>args<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> registers<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>args<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Update program counter to next instruction</span> <span class=\"token constant\">PC</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token constant\">PC</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">2</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">break</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SUB_VX_VY'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// etc...</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nWhat I end up with is the CPU, with all the state and the instruction cycle. There are two methods exposed on the CPU - load, which is the equivalent of loading a cartridge into a console with the romBuffer as the game, and step, which is the three functions of the instruction cycle (fetch, decode, execute). step will run in an infinite loop.\nCPU.js\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">CPU</span> <span

game.\nCreating a CPU Interface for I/O\nSo now I have this CPU that's interpreting and executing instructions and updating all its own state, but I can't do anything with it yet. In order to play a game, you have to see it and be able to interact with it.\nThis is where input/output, or I/O, comes in. I/O is the communication between the CPU and the outside world.\nInput is data received by the CPU\nOutput is data sent from the CPU\nSo for me, the input will be through the keyboard, and the output will be graphics onto the screen.\nI could just mix the I/O code in with the CPU directly, but then I would be tied to one environment. By creating a generic CPU interface to connect the I/O and the CPU, I can interface with any system.\nThe first thing to do was look through the instructions and find any that have to do with I/O. A few examples of those instructions:\nCLS - Clear the screen\nLD Vx, K - Wait for a key press, store the value of the key in Vx.\nDRW Vx, Vy, nibble - Display n-byte sprite starting at memory location I\nBased on that, we'll want the interface to have methods like:\nclearDisplay()\nwaitKey()\ndrawPixel() (drawSprite would have been 1:1, but it ended up to be easier doing it pixel-by-pixel from the interface)\nJavaScript doesn't really have a concept of an abstract class as far as I could find, but I created one by making a class that could not itself be instantiated, with methods that can only be used from classes that extend it. Here are all the interface methods on the class:\nCpuInterface.js\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Abstract CPU interface class</span>\n<span class=\"token

initialization, and the CPU will be able to access methods on the interface.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">CPU</span> <span

real environment (web, terminal, or native) I created a mock interface for tests. It doesn't actually hook up to any I/O but it helped me to set up the state of the interface and prepare it for real data. I'll ignore the sound ones, because that was never implemented with actual speaker output, so that leaves the keyboard and screen.\nScreen\nThe screen has a resolution of 64 pixels wide by 32 pixels tall. So as far as the CPU and interface is concerned, its a 64x32 grid of bits that are either on or off. To set up an empty screen, I can just make a 3D array of zeroes to represent all pixels being off. A frame buffer is a portion of memory containing a bitmapped image that will be rendered to a display.\nMockCpuInterface.js\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Interface for

the DRW function, the CPU will loop through the sprite it pulled from memory and update each pixel in the sprite (some details left out for brevity).\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token

<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nThe clearDisplay() function is the only other method that will be used for interacting with the screen. This is all the CPU interface needs for interacting with the screen.\nKeys\nFor keys, I mapped the original hex keyboard to the following 4x4 grid of keys:\n<code class=\"language-terminal\">┌───┬───┬───┬───┐\n│ 1 │ 2 │ 3 │ 4 │\n│ Q │ W │ E │ R │\n│ A │ S │ D │ F │\n│ Z │ X │ C │ V │\n└───┴───┴───┴───┘</code>\nI put the keys in an array.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// prettier-ignore</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> keyMap <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span> <span class=\"token string\">'1'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'2'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'3'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'4'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'q'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'w'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'e'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'r'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'a'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'s'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'d'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'f'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'z'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'x'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'c'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'v'</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span></code>\nAnd create some state to store the currently pressed keys.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>keys <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span></code>\nIn the interface, keys is a binary number consisting of 16 digits where each index represents a key. Chip-8 just wants to know at any given time which keys are pressed out of the 16 and makes a decision based on that. A few examples below:\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token number\">0b1000000000000000</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// V is pressed (keyMap[15], or index 15)</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">0b0000000000000011</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// 1 and 2 are pressed (index 0, 1)</span>\n<span class=\"token number\">0b0000000000110000</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Q and W are pressed (index 4, 5)</span></code>\nNow if, for example, V is pressed (keyMap[15]) and the operand is 0xf (decimal 15), the key is pressed. Left shifting (&lt;&lt;) with 1 will create a binary number with a 1 followed by as many zeroes as are in the left shift.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">case</span> <span class=\"token string\">'SKP_VX'</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Skip next instruction if key with the value of Vx is pressed</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>interface<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getKeys</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>registers<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>args<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Skip instruction</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Go to next instruction</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nThere is one other key method, waitKey, where the instruction is to wait for a keypress and return the key once pressed.\nCLI App - Interfacing with the Terminal\nThe first interface I made was for the terminal. This was less familiar to me than working with the DOM as I have never made any sort of graphical app in terminal, but it wasn't too difficult.\nCurses is a library used to create text user interfaces in the terminal. Blessed is a library wrapping curses for Node.js.\nScreen\nThe frame buffer that contains the bitmap of the screen data is the same for all implementations, but the way the screen interfaces with each environment will be different.\nWith blessed, I just defined a screen object:\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>screen <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> blessed<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">screen</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> smartCSR<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code>\nAnd used fillRegion or clearRegion on the pixel with a full unicode block to fill it out, using the frameBuffer as the data source.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token function\">drawPixel</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> value</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>frameBuffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>y<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token operator\">^=</span> value <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>frameBuffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>y<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>screen<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">fillRegion</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>color<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token string\">'█'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>screen<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">clearRegion</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> x <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>screen<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code>\nKeys\nThe key handler was not too different from what I would expect with the DOM.

I made this version of the emulator a bit more fancy, since the browser is more of my familiar environment and I can't resist the urge to make retro looking websites. This one also allows you to switch between games.\nScreen\nFor the screen, I used the Canvas API, which uses CanvasRenderingContext2D for the drawing surface. Using fillRect with canvas was basically the same as fillRegion in blessed.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>screen <span

For the Raylib implementation I accessed the interface directly from the script instead of keeping everything contained in the interface, but it works.\n<code class=\"language-js\">r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">BeginDrawing</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> cpu<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>interface<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>frameBuffer<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forEach</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">y<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> i</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">forEach</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> j</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>x<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">DrawRectangleRec</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> width<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> height <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">GREEN</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">else</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">DrawRectangleRec</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> x<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> y<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> width<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> height <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">BLACK</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">EndDrawing</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code>\nKeys\nGetting the keys to work on Raylib was the last thing I worked on. It was more difficult to figure out because I had to do everything in the IsKeyDown method - there was a GetKeyPressed method, but it had side effects and caused problems. So instead of just waiting for a keypress like the other implementations, I had to loop through all keys and check if they were down, and append them to the key bitmask if so.\n<code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> keyDownIndices <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Run through all possible keys</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">for</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">let</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span> nativeKeyMap<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>length<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> i<span class=\"token operator\">++</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> currentKey <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> nativeKeyMap<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>i<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// If key is already down, add index to key down map</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// This will also lift up any keys that aren't pressed</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>r<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">IsKeyDown</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>currentKey<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> keyDownIndices <span class=\"token operator\">|=</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;&lt;</span> i <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// Set all pressed keys</span>\ncpu<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>interface<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">setKeys</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>keyDownIndices<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code>\nThat's it for the native implementation. It was more of a challenge than the other ones, but I'm glad I did it to round out the interface and see how well it would work on drastically different platforms.\nConclusion\nSo that's my Chip-8 project! Once again, you can check out the source on GitHub. I learned a lot about lower level programming concepts and how a CPU operates, and also about the capabilities of JavaScript outside of a browser app or REST API server. I still have a few things left to do in this project, like attempt to make a (very) simple game, but the emulator is complete, and I'm proud to have finished it.\nAuthor\nHey, I’m Tania, a full stack software engineer.

I've written some\n      personal accounting software - <a href=\"https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/tree/Refactor-examples\">Reconciliate</a>.\n      It works on the\n      command line and performs the following actions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Loads my own comma-separated data:\n          \n<ul>\n<li>My record of recent bank and credit card transactions.</li>\n\n<li>My predicted monthly and annual transactions (based on data in a\n        central spreadsheet).</li>\n\n<li>Any unreconciled previously-recorded data.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n<li>Loads third-party comma-separated data (from bank and credit card companies).</li>\n\n<li>Reconciles the third-party data against my own data.</li>\n\n<li>Writes everything back to a central spreadsheet.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have some bugs that need fixing and some features to add. But my\n      typical workflow is to arrive at the laptop late at night after putting my\n      youngest to bed, with only a small amount of time before it will be <i>my</i>\n      bedtime, and often a few weeks after the last time I saw the code. In\n      these circumstances it's horribly easy to think things like, \"Well I know\n      this code is a mess, but I don't have time to get my head round it and fix\n      it now...\"</p>\n\n<p>Clearly this is not ideal.</p>\n\n<p>There's one class in particular - the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class \n      - which is giving me a headache\n      whenever I look at it. It's bloated and convoluted and impossible to <i>fit\n      in my head</i>&nbsp;<span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-fits-in-my-head\">[2]</a></span>. This has created a nasty \n      feedback loop: \"Because this code is \n      so hard to reason about, refactoring will take more time and energy than I\n      have, so I'll put up with it even longer - even though it means I can't\n      even make small changes any more because it takes so long for me to\n      understand the code's current state and decide where the change should\n      go.\" </p>\n\n<p>For instance, I want to add the ability to handle another credit card.\n      In a lot of places I've used\n      <a href=\"https://medium.com/@shanikae/polymorphism-explained-simply-7294c8deeef7\">polymorphism</a>\n      and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern\">the strategy pattern</a>\n      to keep the unique behaviour of each credit card neatly encapsulated. But\n      the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class is one place where, because of the poor\n      design of the code and the lack of clear \n      <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns\">context separation</a>, \n      if I add another\n      credit card I'll be making an already bloated class even worse. It\n      contains four duplicated code paths for each of four types of data (Bank In,\n      Bank Out, Credit Card 1 and Credit Card 2), and if I add Credit Card 3\n      right now I'll end up following the same anti-pattern.</p>\n\n<p>My overall aim is to replace this code with more generic\n      code, via the strategy pattern <span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-refactoring-to-patterns\">[3]</a></span>. \n      But there are four problems standing in my way:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This one large class, (<code>ReconciliationIntro</code>), is taking too\n        much responsibility.</li>\n\n<li>There's a lot of private nested code, which is hard to unit-test\n        because it has no public interface.</li>\n\n<li>Within <code>ReconciliationIntro</code>, there's one large method that's doing\n        too much.</li>\n\n<li>There are several methods in <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> which use the\n        same repeated pattern but with different details.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\n        I plan to fix all of these problems, in the order listed above. \n        This <a href=\"https://www.martinfowler.com/articles/preparatory-refactoring-example.html\">preparatory refactoring</a>\n        will get me to the point where I can easily encapsulate the behaviour of each credit \n        card / account. As <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032?s=20\">Kent Beck says</a>, \n        \"Make the change easy, then make the easy change.\" \n      </p>\n\n<p>\n        This article is about tackling the first problem in the above list: <i>This class is too\n        large</i>.\n      </p>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"WhyRefactor\">\n<h2>Why refactor?</h2>\n\n<p>I can't easily reason about the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class because it\n      has too many responsibilities. It was originally designed as the\n      entrance hall to the software, and all it did was display a few messages\n      and then instantiate the classes that do the main work.\n      But over time a lot of other code has snuck in.

Yes, of course. \n          Rather than despairing about a lack of time,\n          I could have made small continuous changes whenever I encountered problem areas.\n          That's part of what the refactor stage of\n          the <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/workflowsOfRefactoring/#tdd\">red-green-refactor cycle</a>\n          is for, and it's a habit you can reinstate <i>at any time</i>.\n        </p>\n\n<p>\n          But it's worth acknowledging that when coding under pressure, you're \n          not always in a fit state to make the \n          right choices. Your code \n          can quickly reach a level of crustiness that makes a refactor feel \n          insurmountable.\n          At these times it's always worth using small changes to make things \n          better piece by piece, \n          no matter what state your code is in. \n        </p>\n</aside>\n\n<h2>How do I do it? </h2>\n\n<p>To my\n      mind, the most important principle when refactoring (and when writing new\n      code) is to move in tiny steps. I have several connected aims:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>At every step, I want the code to compile and the tests to run.</li>\n\n<li>If a change causes any tests to fail, I want to be able to fix them\n        instantly. By making small changes and small commits, I can see which\n        change caused the tests to fail and I only need to rewind / examine a\n        small amount of code to find the problem.</li>\n\n<li>I can keep track of where I am in in my head. It's horribly easy to\n        embark on a relatively simple refactor, only to find it has repercussions\n        beyond your original intention. At this point, if you're not in the habit\n        of keeping the code compiling and the tests passing at every step, you can\n        find yourself lost in a rabbit hole that's difficult to exit: Your\n        code isn't compiling and your tests aren't even running, let alone passing.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>\n        For this to work, I need the code being refactored to be\n        covered by tests. This has already been done before I start refactoring, \n        although it's worth noting\n        that one of my aims in a future refactoring will be to make the code even\n        more testable.\n      </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/books/refactoring.html\">Refactoring, by Martin Fowler</a> is a recommended\n        further read and lays out some basic refactoring principles.

Modify the methods that are staying behind</h2>\n\n<p>I've identified two methods - <code>Set_path</code> and\n      <code>Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months</code> - which are called by file-loading\n      methods:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure \" id=\"File-loading-code-diagram-01b-v2-small.png\"><img src=\"class-too-large/File-loading-code-diagram-01b-v2-small.png\">\n<p class=\"photoCaption\">Figure 5: Methods called\n      by file-loading methods (<a href=\"#abbreviations\">abbreviations</a>)</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n<p>As long as those methods are not too tightly coupled with the\n      file-loading class, I can either</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Make them public so I can call back to them from\n        the new <code>FileLoader</code> class.</li>\n\n<li>Move the calls out of the file-loading code and into other native\n        <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> methods instead.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'll use the first approach for <code>Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months</code> and \n      the second for <code>Set_path</code>, which will bring me to the following situation:</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure \" id=\"File-loading-code-diagram-02-v2-sm.png\"><img src=\"class-too-large/File-loading-code-diagram-02-v2-sm.png\">\n<p class=\"photoCaption\">Figure 6: \n      File-loading methods after moving (<a href=\"#abbreviations\">abbreviations</a>)</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n\n<p>Note that the methods marked as <code>FileLoader</code> methods in the diagram\n      will still be in the <code>ReconciliationIntro</code> class at the end of this step,\n      but this will <i>enable</i> me to move them into the <code>FileLoader</code> class, which\n      will happen in <a href=\"#create-fileloader\">step 5</a> \n      and <a href=\"#move-methods\">step 6</a> below.</p>\n\n<p><code>Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months</code> will eventually be a public\n      method in another class, but for now I just want to make sure I can call\n      it from elsewhere. It turns out it already is public, which was done so\n      that it could be tested. This in itself is a code smell - it's a sign\n      that it would be better off as part of the public interface of a separate\n      class.</p>\n\n<p>The other method called from the file-loading code is <code>Set_path</code>. This\n      changes the value of an internal path variable, so I'll choose option 2:\n      I'll call it separately and pass the resulting data into the file-loading\n      method via a parameter. </p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\" id=\"one-thing\">\n<h2>Principle: Do one thing at a time. Focus!</h2>\n\n<p>In the process of editing <code>Set_path</code>, I've noticed a couple of other\n        changes I want to make. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, <code>Set_path</code> has the side effect of altering the\n        <code>_path</code> member variable. It would be better if it was\n        self-contained and just returned a new path. </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, currently <code>Set_path</code> is being called in two\n        places - just before <code>Create_pending_csvs</code> is called, and much\n        lower down in the chain of events, from within another method called\n        <code>Set_path_and_file_names</code>. If I follow the chain of different\n        methods involved here, I realise they're not called in a sensible order\n        and there's a lot of redundancy. The code is hard to follow, and it \n        would be tempting to refactor it now. </p>\n\n<p>But I'm in the middle of another refactoring, so I make a note (on my\n        Trello board) and leave these changes for later. Otherwise I'll get\n        distracted from the task at hand and could get the code into a strange\n        state and lose track of what I'm doing. Focus is important!</p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>Note that these might not normally stay as separate commits (I could use\n      micro-commits and then squash them into larger commits), but I'm keeping\n      the small commits intact to make the steps clear.

Ideally my functionality\n      will already be covered by tests, and when refactoring I'm not changing\n      the functionality. So instead of writing new tests, I'm using the existing ones\n      to verify the functionality still works as originally intended.</p>\n\n<p>This is a good time to review this test: It's a while since I wrote\n      it, so I should be able to spot quickly whether it makes sense. I want\n      my tests to be clear and easy to read - they should act as documentation\n      for my system behaviour. The first thing I notice is that it contains an\n      assert method - <code>Assert_direct_debit_details_are_correct</code> - whose name\n      is inadequate. What is the definition of \"correct\"? I rewrite the test\n      to make it easier to read, which involves quite a lot of changes. In the\n      interest of keeping this a digestible read I won't go into the changes\n      made, but you can view them in <a href=\"https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/f090f26\">commit f090f26</a>\n      and <a href=\"https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/6a6cece\">commit 6a6cece</a>. <span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-commits-not-compulsory\">[4]</a></span></p>\n\n<p>Now that I've refactored the test I'll copy it into a new test\n      class, along with some associated private helper methods. Note that\n      although this and other tests are destined to operate on a new\n      <code>FileLoader</code> class, they'll still act on the old <code>ReconciliationIntro</code>\n      class until I'm sure my new test class has everything it needs. Also\n      note that until everything is safely moved, my test code is duplicated.\n      </p>\n\n<aside class=\"sidebar\" id=\"automated refactorings\">\n<h2>Automated refactorings</h2>\n\n<p>\n          It's worth being aware that there are many automatable refactoring tasks \n          which require significantly more care when tools like\n          <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/\">Resharper</a>&nbsp;<span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-resharper\">[5]</a></span>\n          are not available.\n        </p>\n\n<p>\n          For instance, with Resharper you can quickly\n          and confidently rename a method that has clients throughout a large code base. \n          But without this tool, such a change might be handled differently\n          - for instance by creating a temporary wrapper method.\n        </p>\n</aside>\n\n<p>I first create the new test class in the same file as the original\n      (<a href=\"https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/491c795\">commit 491c795</a>) <span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-commits-not-compulsory\">[4]</a></span>, so that it's easy to see what I'm copying.\n      Then I can get <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/\">Resharper</a>&nbsp;<span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-resharper\">[5]</a></span> and Visual Studio to move everything into a new file for\n      me (<a href=\"https://github.com/claresudbery/Reconciliate/commit/c9317c0\">commit c9317c0</a>) <span class=\"foot-ref\"><a href=\"#footnote-commits-not-compulsory\">[4]</a></span>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"figure \" id=\"Move-BBO-Tests-02-v5-small.png\"><img src=\"class-too-large/Move-BBO-Tests-02-v5-small.png\">\n<p class=\"photoCaption\">Figure 7: Move BBO tests</p>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"create-fileloader\">\n<h2>5.

Focus!\nAutomated refactorings\nA note on member variables\nA note on the order of the commits\nThe reality: Most teams own problematic code\nThis is a story about refactoring. It's the third item in the TDD red-green-refactor cycle[1] and it's the thing we do all the time, right? Except when we don't.\nI have an unruly code base which has suffered from refactoring neglect, so I've been bringing it back into line. In this article I will take a class that is too large, and make it smaller.\nLanguage and approach\nC#\nI generally write code in whatever language suits the client, the project and the problem at hand. But the majority of my career has been in the .Net space, so C# is my comfort zone and my default go-to. The examples in this article are written in C#, but I hope the code snippets included are simple enough to follow even if you don't know the language.\nTest-driven development\nI'm a big fan of Test-Driven Development (TDD) [1], and the code presented here was mostly written using that approach. But I have to confess that after 20 years as an engineer, I have at least half a career of bad habits behind me and I don't always get things right.\nOutline of the problem\nThe story begins with a boring domestic chore. I've written some personal accounting software - Reconciliate. It works on the command line and performs the following actions:\nLoads my own comma-separated data:\nMy record of recent bank and credit card transactions.\nMy predicted monthly and annual transactions (based on data in a central spreadsheet).\nAny unreconciled previously-recorded data.\nLoads third-party comma-separated data (from bank and credit card companies).\nReconciles the third-party data against my own data.\nWrites everything back to a central spreadsheet.\nI have some bugs that need fixing and some features to add. But my typical workflow is to arrive at the laptop late at night after putting my youngest to bed, with only a small amount of time before it will be my bedtime, and often a few weeks after the last time I saw the code. In these circumstances it's horribly easy to think things like, \"Well I know this code is a mess, but I don't have time to get my head round it and fix it now...\"\nClearly this is not ideal.\nThere's one class in particular - the ReconciliationIntro class - which is giving me a headache whenever I look at it. It's bloated and convoluted and impossible to fit in my head [2]. This has created a nasty feedback loop: \"Because this code is so hard to reason about, refactoring will take more time and energy than I have, so I'll put up with it even longer - even though it means I can't even make small changes any more because it takes so long for me to understand the code's current state and decide where the change should go.\"\nFor instance, I want to add the ability to handle another credit card. In a lot of places I've used polymorphism and the strategy pattern to keep the unique behaviour of each credit card neatly encapsulated. But the ReconciliationIntro class is one place where, because of the poor design of the code and the lack of clear context separation, if I add another credit card I'll be making an already bloated class even worse. It contains four duplicated code paths for each of four types of data (Bank In, Bank Out, Credit Card 1 and Credit Card 2), and if I add Credit Card 3 right now I'll end up following the same anti-pattern.\nMy overall aim is to replace this code with more generic code, via the strategy pattern [3]. But there are four problems standing in my way:\nThis one large class, (ReconciliationIntro), is taking too much responsibility.\nThere's a lot of private nested code, which is hard to unit-test because it has no public interface.\nWithin ReconciliationIntro, there's one large method that's doing too much.\nThere are several methods in ReconciliationIntro which use the same repeated pattern but with different details.\nI plan to fix all of these problems, in the order listed above. This preparatory refactoring will get me to the point where I can easily encapsulate the behaviour of each credit card / account. As Kent Beck says, \"Make the change easy, then make the easy change.\"\nThis article is about tackling the first problem in the above list: This class is too large.\nWhy refactor?\nI can't easily reason about the ReconciliationIntro class because it has too many responsibilities. It was originally designed as the entrance hall to the software, and all it did was display a few messages and then instantiate the classes that do the main work. But over time a lot of other code has snuck in. I want to make it easier to add another credit card, so I'm going to start by breaking this large class into smaller classes.\nThe benefits will be several:\nBy moving groups of methods into separate classes I'll create clear contexts and minimise tight coupling. This means that:\nI'll know where to go when I want to make changes or fix issues.\nWhen I amend the code, I'll only have to work with small isolated sections that fit in my head [2] - I won't have to understand the whole system.\nAny manipulation of state will only happen locally in a small context - so I won't have to worry about one area of the system changing state in another.\nHow to avoid getting here in the first place\nCould I have avoided being in this position? Yes, of course. Rather than despairing about a lack of time, I could have made small continuous changes whenever I encountered problem areas. That's part of what the refactor stage of the red-green-refactor cycle is for, and it's a habit you can reinstate at any time.\nBut it's worth acknowledging that when coding under pressure, you're not always in a fit state to make the right choices. Your code can quickly reach a level of crustiness that makes a refactor feel insurmountable. At these times it's always worth using small changes to make things better piece by piece, no matter what state your code is in.\nHow do I do it?\nTo my mind, the most important principle when refactoring (and when writing new code) is to move in tiny steps. I have several connected aims:\nAt every step, I want the code to compile and the tests to run.\nIf a change causes any tests to fail, I want to be able to fix them instantly. By making small changes and small commits, I can see which change caused the tests to fail and I only need to rewind / examine a small amount of code to find the problem.\nI can keep track of where I am in in my head. It's horribly easy to embark on a relatively simple refactor, only to find it has repercussions beyond your original intention. At this point, if you're not in the habit of keeping the code compiling and the tests passing at every step, you can find yourself lost in a rabbit hole that's difficult to exit: Your code isn't compiling and your tests aren't even running, let alone passing.\nFor this to work, I need the code being refactored to be covered by tests. This has already been done before I start refactoring, although it's worth noting that one of my aims in a future refactoring will be to make the code even more testable.\nRefactoring, by Martin Fowler is a recommended further read and lays out some basic refactoring principles. He also emphasises the value of moving in tiny steps and building the code / running your tests after every small commit.\nBeyond these basic principles, I'll aim to follow a logical series of steps which are outlined below.\nHow to read this article\nThis is a real code base and a messy code base (hence the refactoring), so there's a lot of code. For those who want to know more, I do link to the code repeatedly. But I've deliberately kept the descriptions high-level, and you don't need to follow those links.\n1. Rearrange methods\nI'll start by using regions to rearrange all the methods in the ReconciliationIntro class into sensible groupings&nbsp;(commit f2d9932) [4]:\nFigure 1: ReconciliationIntro after methods rearranged into regions\nPrinciple: Always commit moves and renames separately from edits.\nIt's important that I move code around like this as a separate task and in a separate commit, without editing the code in any way. When you rearrange methods, the resulting code difference will include many added/deleted chunks of code. If the code has been changed as well as moved, you can't easily tell whether lines have been deleted or moved, and whether moved lines are the same or different. As Dan Terhorst-North says, \"A change should be structural or behavioural, but never both.\"\nFigure 2: What a commit looks like when you've moved code around\nNow that I've grouped my methods into what feels like a reasonable set of contexts, I'd like to pull these out into separate classes. But where to start? The file loading code contains the most duplication, and is causing the most pain. Ultimately I want to make this code more generic, but first I want to pull it out so I can see it without distraction. I'll extract a new FileLoader class. The other groupings will also become separate classes but they'll be a lot simpler, so I'll focus most of this article on the file-loading code.\nAbbreviated method names\nThe naming of anything - from methods to pubs to children - is a notoriously difficult enterprise. My tendency to verbosity is as evident in my method names as it is in the longwinded stories you'll hear if you meet me in a pub. Before refactoring, the duplication of code meant that method names were being used to differentiate between contexts - and this resulted in some long names. To avoid gigantic images I've abbreviated names in most of the diagrams, as follows:\nBBI: bank_and_bank_in (\"bank\" and \"bank_in\" represent two different views - the bank's, and my own)\nBBO: bank_and_bank_out (\"bank\" and \"bank_out\" as with \"bank\" and \"bank_in\" above)\nCC1: cred_card1_and_cred_card1_in_out (\"cred_card1\" and \"cred_card1_in_out\" as with \"bank\" and \"bank_in\" above)\nCC2: cred_card2_and_cred_card2_in_out (as with \"cred_card1\" above)\nMerge_bd: Merge_bespoke_data\nBM: budgeting_months\nccds: credit_card_debits\nwpf: with_pending_file\nCC: cred_card\nDDs: direct_debits\n2. Analyse relationships between file-loading methods\nSo far all I've done is move some code around in the same class. I rebuilt the code and ran all the tests before I committed, but unless I was clumsy I'd expect my previous commit to be trivial. I need to be a little more thoughtful about what I do next.\nI've used one of my regions to identify methods to pull out into a new FileLoader class, but how can I be sure this will work? Are there any hidden dependencies? I'll discover this by drawing out the relationships between the methods I want to move. The ones to be moved are marked in blue.\nFigure 3: File-loading methods to be moved (abbreviations)\nI can see straight away that it's not a strictly self-contained context: Some of the blue methods are calling back out to methods (shown in black and green) that I want to keep in a separate class. There are a couple of ways I could handle this, which I discuss below. But now I'm at a place where I can define a plan of action.\nPlan of action\nBy the time I'm done, the original large ReconciliationIntro class will have been broken down into the pared-down version plus five new classes shown in the diagram below. Note that there isn't a one-to-one mapping between regions and classes, because later on when I reach step 7, I'll end up refining my first groupings into some finer-grained boundaries.\nFigure 4: Plan of action\nMy overall aim is to break this large class down into smaller classes. In steps 1 and 2 above, I used regions and a diagram to identify distinct areas of code and then analyse relationships between some of the methods. That gave me enough information to start thinking about how I can tackle this job in tiny steps.\nThe resulting plan is summarised below and then described in detail further down. I reached this plan by thinking about how I could proceed using steps that were as small as possible. Often what I'm doing is setting things up so that the next change will be as small and simple as possible. I'm making small changes to facilitate more small changes - yet again following Kent Beck's dictum to \"Make the change easy, then make the easy change.\"\nDepending on your circumstances you might not follow the same plan, but it's not a bad template if you're not sure how to proceed. Your priority is to set yourself up for safe incremental changes:\nRearrange methods\nGroup all the methods in the class into sensible groupings, as described above.\nAnalyse relationships between file-loading methods\nIdentify how the file-loading code is connected to the rest of the code in the ReconciliationIntro class, as described above.\nModify the methods that are staying behind\nThere are methods which will stay in the parent class but are currently called by those that are moving. Some modification will be required to make this work.\nCreate covering tests for the new FileLoader class\nThe new FileLoader class needs to be covered by tests. The tests for the code to be moved already exist, but they'll be moved into a new FileLoaderTests class.\nCreate new FileLoader class and move two methods\nFollowing the principle of tiny steps, I'll move just two methods (a public method and a private method called by it) before I move the rest.\nMove the other methods to the new FileLoader class\nThis is where it gets exciting. All that file-loading code I'm interested in will finally get a new home!\nExtract more new classes\nOnce I've dealt with the file-loading code, I'll create some more new classes for the other code regions.\nThe new FileLoader class will be responsible for loading various sources of comma-separated data and merging them ready for reconciliation. This file-loading code is where most of the pain currently lies, so that's the bit I'll describe in the most detail. You can see the original code before refactoring here, but if you follow that link all you'll learn is that it's too big to fit in your head! The slimmed down post-refactor version is here.\nSo, now I can continue with the plan:\n3. Modify the methods that are staying behind\nI've identified two methods - Set_path and Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months - which are called by file-loading methods:\nFigure 5: Methods called by file-loading methods (abbreviations)\nAs long as those methods are not too tightly coupled with the file-loading class, I can either\nMake them public so I can call back to them from the new FileLoader class.\nMove the calls out of the file-loading code and into other native ReconciliationIntro methods instead.\nI'll use the first approach for Recursively_ask_for_budgeting_months and the second for Set_path, which will bring me to the following situation:\nFigure 6: File-loading methods after moving (abbreviations)\nNote that the methods marked as FileLoader methods in the diagram will still be in the ReconciliationIntro class at the end of this step, but this will enable me to move them into the FileLoader class, which will happen in step 5 and step 6 below.\nRecursively_ask_for_budgeting_months will eventually be a public method in another class, but for now I just want to make sure I can call it from elsewhere. It turns out it already is public, which was done so that it could be tested. This in itself is a code smell - it's a sign that it would be better off as part of the public interface of a separate class.\nThe other method called from the file-loading code is Set_path. This changes the value of an internal path variable, so I'll choose option 2: I'll call it separately and pass the resulting data into the file-loading method via a parameter.\nPrinciple: Do one thing at a time. Focus!\nIn the process of editing Set_path, I've noticed a couple of other changes I want to make.\nFirstly, Set_path has the side effect of altering the _path member variable. It would be better if it was self-contained and just returned a new path.\nSecondly, currently Set_path is being called in two places - just before Create_pending_csvs is called, and much lower down in the chain of events, from within another method called Set_path_and_file_names. If I follow the chain of different methods involved here, I realise they're not called in a sensible order and there's a lot of redundancy. The code is hard to follow, and it would be tempting to refactor it now.\nBut I'm in the middle of another refactoring, so I make a note (on my Trello board) and leave these changes for later. Otherwise I'll get distracted from the task at hand and could get the code into a strange state and lose track of what I'm doing. Focus is important!\nNote that these might not normally stay as separate commits (I could use micro-commits and then squash them into larger commits), but I'm keeping the small commits intact to make the steps clear. I compile and run the tests at every step:\nModify the calling method (Create_pending_csvs) so that it takes a parameter, but initially give it a default value (commit acc3519) [4] so that the code still compiles:\nprivate void Create_pending_csvs()\n{ // Some code\n} ⇓ private void Create_pending_csvs(<span class=\"colblind-highlight\">string path = \"\"</span>)\n{ // Some code\n}\nCall Set_path separately before calling Create_pending_csvs. Take the resulting new _path member variable (see sidebar), and pass it into Create_pending_csvs (commit c5ebc2f) [4]:\ncase \"1\":\n{ Create_pending_csvs();\n}\nbreak; ⇓ case \"1\":\n{ Set_path(); Create_pending_csvs(<span class=\"colblind-highlight\">_path</span>);\n}\nbreak;\nRemove the call to Set_path from within Create_pending_csvs, and use the passed-in value instead of the member variable (commit 6df8f97) [4]:\nprivate void Create_pending_csvs(string path = \"\")\n{ try { Set_path(); var pending_csv_file_creator = new PendingCsvFileCreator(_path); ⇓ private void Create_pending_csvs(string path = \"\")\n{ try { <span class=\"colblind-deleted\">Set_path();</span> var pending_csv_file_creator = new PendingCsvFileCreator(<span class=\"colblind-highlight\">path</span>);\nFinally, remove the default value from the Create_pending_csvs parameter - thereby forcing all clients to pass a value in (commit 2be56ea) [4]. Note that by doing things in this order, I keep the code compiling at all times:\nprivate void Create_pending_csvs(string path = \"\")\n{ // Some code\n} ⇓ private void Create_pending_csvs(string path <span class=\"colblind-deleted\">= \"\"</span>)\n{ // Some code\n}\n4. Create covering tests for the new FileLoader class\nMy first choice of method to move will be Bank_and_bank_out_ _Merge_bespoke_data_with_pending_file. And the first thing I want to do is copy any covering tests into a new test class for the about-to-be-created FileLoader class. There is already one test for this method - M_MergeBespokeDataWithPendingFile_ WillAddMostRecentCredCardDirectDebits - and its job is to make sure this method merges new direct debit data correctly with a 'pending' file (which is being built to contain all new transaction data).\nNote that I'm only moving tests, not writing new ones. People can get so used to the TDD [1] concept of writing tests before writing code that they assume you need to write new tests whenever you work on code. This is often not the case when refactoring. Ideally my functionality will already be covered by tests, and when refactoring I'm not changing the functionality. So instead of writing new tests, I'm using the existing ones to verify the functionality still works as originally intended.\nThis is a good time to review this test: It's a while since I wrote it, so I should be able to spot quickly whether it makes sense. I want my tests to be clear and easy to read - they should act as documentation for my system behaviour. The first thing I notice is that it contains an assert method - Assert_direct_debit_details_are_correct - whose name is inadequate. What is the definition of \"correct\"? I rewrite the test to make it easier to read, which involves quite a lot of changes. In the interest of keeping this a digestible read I won't go into the changes made, but you can view them in commit f090f26 and commit 6a6cece. [4]\nNow that I've refactored the test I'll copy it into a new test class, along with some associated private helper methods. Note that although this and other tests are destined to operate on a new FileLoader class, they'll still act on the old ReconciliationIntro class until I'm sure my new test class has everything it needs. Also note that until everything is safely moved, my test code is duplicated.\nAutomated refactorings\nIt's worth being aware that there are many automatable refactoring tasks which require significantly more care when tools like Resharper [5] are not available.\nFor instance, with Resharper you can quickly and confidently rename a method that has clients throughout a large code base. But without this tool, such a change might be handled differently - for instance by creating a temporary wrapper method.\nI first create the new test class in the same file as the original (commit 491c795) [4], so that it's easy to see what I'm copying. Then I can get Resharper [5] and Visual Studio to move everything into a new file for me (commit c9317c0) [4].\nFigure 7: Move BBO tests\n5. Create new FileLoader class and move two methods\nNow that my test class is up and running, I can create the new FileLoader class.\nThe method that's furthest down the chain - the lowest leaf in my tree of methods - is Bank_and_bank_out__ Add_most_recent_credit_card_direct_debits. This is a private method with no independent tests (it's tested via the public calling method), so I'm going to move both it and its caller (Bank_and_bank_out__ Merge_bespoke_data_with_pending_file). These will be the first two methods to be moved into my new class.\nAgain, I'll move in baby steps to avoid my tests going red and keep my code building at all times. After each of the following steps I make sure the code builds and the tests are passing.\nThis is the situation I begin with. A FileLoaderTests class has been created, but it is testing code that still lives in the ReconciliationIntro class:\nFigure 8: New FileLoader class part 1 (abbreviations)\nI start by creating a new FileLoader class. One of my file-loading methods (Bank_and_bank_out__ Add_most_recent_credit_card_direct_debits) is private, and will also be private at the end of this process. It will only ever be called by the method that's about to follow it into the new class. It's not individually covered by tests, so I can just copy it over to the new class and have it ready and waiting when its caller is moved (see commit 0341476) [4]. But I will need to make it temporarily public:\nFigure 9: New FileLoader class part 2 (abbreviations)\nNow I can create an instance of my new FileLoader class in the ReconciliationIntro class and call its new public method, instead of the old private method. I can also delete the old private method (see commit bde2ae2) [4]:\nFigure 10: New FileLoader class part 3 (abbreviations)\nCopy the original caller into the new class (see commit f0a5a59) [4]. Note that at this point it's duplicated:\nFigure 11: New FileLoader class part 4 (abbreviations)\nChange the object I'm testing from being a ReconciliationIntro instance to being a new FileLoader instance. Point the tests at the new copy of the original caller. Note that because the private method it calls has also been copied, my tests will pass (see commit 3d573e3) [4]:\nFigure 12: New FileLoader class part 5 (abbreviations)\nNow I can call the original caller directly from the ReconciliationIntro class (see commit 77c0b14) [4]:\nFigure 13: New FileLoader class part 6 (abbreviations)\nMake the originally-private method private again, and delete the original caller. I'll delete the old test class too, as all its tests have now been duplicated in FileLoaderTests. (see commit 27f1a59) [4]:\nFigure 14: New FileLoader class part 7 (abbreviations)\n6. Move the other methods to the new FileLoader class\nNow I can move all the other methods. I'll handle them one by one, starting with the simplest and keeping an eye out for dependencies (between methods, and on any member data). I'll need to consider the following:\nDo I want to rename any methods?\nDo I want to replace any parameter lists with new objects?\nAre there any redundant parameters?\nAre any of the internal nested callees altering state? What impact does this have?\nI could inline those lower down in the chain before moving them, but if I did I'd break the tests which call them as public methods. So instead I move them on their own. I do it in the order explained below, acting on one at a time and starting with those at the end of the chain - ie the outermost leaves on the following tree:\nFigure 15: FileLoader method tree (abbreviations)\nFor each one, I use the following approach:\nCreate a copy of the method in the destination class, keeping the original in place. Make the new method public.\nCall the new method instead of the original.\nCopy any covering tests into the new test class, and make sure they test the new code.\nDelete the old method and the old tests.\nI already moved Bank_and_bank_out__ Merge_bespoke_data_with_pending_file and Bank_and_bank_out__ Add_most_recent_credit_card_direct_debits (commit 0341476 to commit 27f1a59), so now I repeat the same actions for each of the other methods (commit 7cd53f6 to commit 7ab95f2) [4]. I don't commit every tiny step this time, but I still go through the same set of steps. After each step, I make sure the code builds and the tests are passing (apart from when I deliberately make a test fail).\nI refactored some tests earlier, and I can repeat those changes for tests that follow the same pattern. For some methods the move is very simple, because they have no test coverage. This is part of why I'm doing this refactor, to make that code more easily testable.\nA note on member variables\nThe four load methods (Load_bank_and_bank_in, etc) are all using two member variables from ReconciliationIntro: _input_output and _spreadsheet_factory. So when these methods are added to FileLoader, I need to introduce these variables as members in FileLoader too, by injecting them into the constructor. _input_output is already being injected, but when I introduce _spreadsheet_factory I initially give it a default value. This is so the code will still build, and is done before I switch over to using the new methods. This way I can fix all the places that need to inject a spreadsheet factory into FileLoader at my leisure.\nSee commit ce559f2 and commit 7e86292 for the actual code changes [4], but here is a simplification focusing only on the relevant parts:\ninternal class ReconciliationIntro\n{ private readonly IInputOutput _input_output; public ReconciliationInterface Load_correct_files() { Load_bank_and_bank_in(); } public ReconciliationInterface Load_bank_and_bank_in() { var file_loader = new FileLoader(_input_output); file_loader.Load_bank_and_bank_in(); }\n} internal class FileLoader\n{ private readonly IInputOutput _input_output; public FileLoader(IInputOutput input_output) { _input_output = input_output; } public ReconciliationInterface Load_bank_and_bank_in() { _input_output.Output_line(\"Some text\"); }\n} ⇓ // Still compiles, because ISpreadsheetRepoFactory object has default value in constructor. internal class FileLoader\n{ private readonly IInputOutput _input_output;\n<span class=\"colblind-highlight\"> private readonly ISpreadsheetRepoFactory _spreadsheet_factory;</span> public FileLoader( IInputOutput input_output, <span class=\"colblind-highlight\"> ISpreadsheetRepoFactory spreadsheet_factory = null)</span> { _input_output = input_output;\n<span class=\"colblind-highlight\"> _spreadsheet_factory = spreadsheet_factory;</span> } public ReconciliationInterface Load_bank_and_bank_in() {\n<span class=\"colblind-highlight\"> var pending_file_io = new FileIO&lt;BankRecord&gt;(_spreadsheet_factory);</span> _input_output.Output_line(\"Some text\"); }\n} ⇓ // Now ReconciliationIntro can inject member vars into FileLoader and it will all work.\n// Other clients aren't injecting yet, but some time soon we'll amend them all.\n// Finally after that we can remove the default value from the FileLoader constructor. internal class ReconciliationIntro\n{ private readonly IInputOutput _input_output;\n<span class=\"colblind-highlight\"> private readonly ISpreadsheetRepoFactory <span class=\"colblind-highlight\">_spreadsheet_factory</span>;</span> public ReconciliationInterface Load_correct_files() { var file_loader = new FileLoader(_input_output, <span class=\"colblind-highlight\">_spreadsheet_factory</span>); file_loader.Load_bank_and_bank_in(); }\n}\n7. Extract more new classes A note on the order of the commits\nMy main motivation for this refactoring is to remove duplication and introduce a strategy pattern [3] for the four data types in the file loading code. This means that if you look at the commits you'll see that after extracting the FileLoader class, I moved on to other things. But when I came back to write up this article, I couldn't bear to leave the ReconciliationIntro class in its still-bloated state, so I got on with extracting the rest of the classes - starting from commit 3446a54.\nWhen adding regions at the start, I identified some Get budgeting months functionality which creates its own clear context, so I extract these methods out into a new BudgetingMonthService class. This is very quick and simple because these methods only have one public entry point (see commit 6103f0b) [4].\nReconciliationIntro is still too big, but the methods all call one another and now that I've spent more time refamiliarising myself with the code I'm not convinced my two remaining regions of User Instructions and Input and Debug Spreadsheet Operations are the best ways of dividing the remaining code. To help myself think about it, I use a spreadsheet to quickly illustrate the call hierarchy.\nFigure 16: Call hierarchy\nThis allows me to see that there are THREE self-contained areas of code, not two: User instructions, Gathering file / path info and Debug mode switching code.\nI remove the original regions (commit 4c57927) and replace them with four new regions (commit 3446a54) [4]. I rearrange the methods to fit in the new regions, and these will now translate into three new classes: Communicator, PathSetter and DebugModeSwitcher (FileLoader and BudgetingMonthService are not shown on this diagram because they have already been extracted):\nFigure 17: Identifying final ReconciliationIntro classes\nI create these new classes gradually and safely using the same principles as for BudgetingMonthService, removing the new regions once they've served their purpose (see commit 7f464a4 to commit 7e118c1).\nIt's worth noting that when extracting new classes from a larger class, I want them to be independent. For this reason I'm deliberately avoiding the anti-pattern which can sometimes arise, where extracted classes are automatically injected as a dependency into the constructor of the original class.\nThe PathSetter class turns out to be non-trivial - see commit 2921220 to commit 398539a[4]. This is due to the currently-slightly-tortuous nature of the path-setting code, something I noticed at the end of step 3. By extracting this code into a separate class and giving it its own clear context, I'm already making this code a bit better - but it will still need some attention.\nFinally, my ReconciliationIntro class is cleaner and simpler, and the original 41 methods have been reduced to three: Start, Reconciliate and Do_matching:\nFigure 18: Final ReconciliationIntro class\nRecap The reality: Most teams own problematic code\nNote that it's tempting to say, \"But your code only got into this state because you were coding alone, late at night in snatched chunks of spare time. Well-disciplined teams with amazing software engineering practices would never see their code bases get into this state.\" But most teams are not perfect, and most teams find themselves taking shortcuts because of time pressures at some time or other. Sometimes brilliant teams have to handle code written by less-fortunate teams. For whatever reasons, it is likely that most software engineers will find themselves at some point or other having to refactor code that has got out of hand.\nI confess I've been nervous about exposing my code base to the public gaze, because clearly it's far from perfect. But this is reality. Even the best coders (and I don't count myself as one of them) will likely have problematic code lurking somewhere on their hard drives.\nMy class was too large. I had developed undesirable coding habits and I wanted to stop and make things better before adding any new functionality.\nTo fix my too-large class, I took the following actions:\nRearranged methods into sensible groupings, to help identify new classes.\nAnalysed relationships between file-loading methods, so that I could work out how to create a new FileLoader class with minimum coupling with the rest of the code.\nModified the methods that were staying behind, so that they could be called by those that are moving (if necessary).\nCreated covering tests for the new FileLoader class, by creating a new FileLoaderTests class.\nCreated the new FileLoader class and moved two methods.\nMoved the other methods to the new FileLoader class.\nExtracted more new classes.\nI moved in tiny steps, and I compiled and ran the tests at every step. Now I have a much smaller class which calls functionality from several other also-smaller classes, and each one of them is easier to fit in my head.\nWhat's next?\nNote that this article ends in the middle of the refactor, so if you want to see the relevant state of the code before moving on to the next steps, you need to checkout the commit 6103f0b. Note also that I completed most of step 7 in this article after that commit (explanation here).\nAt commit 6103f0b, I've pulled the file-loading code out into the FileLoader class and have a clearer view of the main challenge. The following four methods (visible in situ here) are clearly problematic:\nLoad_bank_and_bank_in\nLoad_bank_and_bank_out\nLoad_cred_card1_and_cred_card1_in_out\nLoad_cred_card2_and_cred_card2_in_out\nThey have the following problems:\nThere is a lot of duplication - at a glance, they look identical.\nThey are way too long.\nThey create objects internally and pass them into one another in a closely inter-dependent way which is not testable.\nThese are all problems I want to solve, but before I do any more refactoring I really need some tests around those methods. That's what I'll do next. My desire is to write about it in a follow-up article, but I've learnt better than to make promises about that kind of thing, so for now it's an exercise for the reader.\nAcknowledgements\nMany thanks to the following people, who very kindly read early drafts of this article and contributed invaluable feedback and suggestions: Paula Paul, Martin Fowler, Priti Biyani, Riccardo Novaglia, Dan Terhorst-North, Kevlin Henney, Steve Freeman, Jon Skeet, Sal Freudenberg, Joe Ray, Chris Shepherd, Luke Morton, Scott Giminiani, Richard Foster, Marcos Bezerra, Sam Carrington.\nFootnotes\n1: TDD stands for Test-Driven Development, a technique to ensure that all units of code are tested, and that the tests describe the behaviour of the system.

Examples of such systems include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Mobile apps that store data on the local device, and that need to sync that\ndata to other devices belonging to the same user (such as calendars, notes,\ncontacts, or reminders);</li>\n  <li>Distributed databases, which maintain multiple replicas of the data (in the\nsame datacenter or in different locations) so that the system continues\nworking correctly if some of the replicas are offline;</li>\n  <li>Collaboration software, such as Google Docs, Trello, Figma, or many others, in\nwhich several users can concurrently make changes to the same file or data;</li>\n  <li>Large-scale data storage and processing systems, which replicate data in order\nto achieve global scalability.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All such systems need to deal with the fact that the data may be concurrently\nmodified on different replicas. Broadly speaking, there are two possible ways of\ndealing with such data modifications:</p>\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>Strongly consistent replication:</dt>\n  <dd>In this model, the replicas coordinate with each other to decide when and how\nto apply the modifications. This approach enables strong consistency models\nsuch as serializable transactions and linearizability. However, waiting for\nthis coordination reduces the performance of these systems; moreover, the CAP\ntheorem tells us that it is impossible to make any data changes on a replica\nwhile it is disconnected from the rest of the system (e.g. due to a network\npartition, or because it is a mobile device with intermittent connectivity).</dd>\n  <dt>Optimistic replication:</dt>\n  <dd>In this model, users may modify the data on any replica independently of any\nother replica, even if the replica is offline or disconnected from the others.\nThis approach enables maximum performance and availability, but it can lead to\nconflicts when multiple clients or users concurrently modify the same piece of\ndata. These conflicts then need to be resolved when the replicas communicate\nwith each other.</dd>\n</dl>\n\n<p>Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) are used in systems with optimistic\nreplication, where they take care of conflict resolution. CRDTs ensure that, no\nmatter what data modifications are made on different replicas, the data can\nalways be merged into a consistent state. This merge is performed automatically\nby the CRDT, without requiring any special conflict resolution code or user\nintervention.</p>\n\n<p>For more details on CRDTs, you can read the article\n“<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.06358.pdf\">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</a>”\nby Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marc Shapiro (2018), or the older\n“<a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00555588/document\">A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types</a>”\nby Marc Shapiro, Nuno Preguiça, Carlos Baquero, and Marek Zawirski (2011).</p>\n\n<script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js\" integrity=\"sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n\n<script>\n$(document).ready(function() {\n\n    var toc = $('#TOC');\n\n    // Select each header\n    sections = $('.td-content h1');\n        $.each(sections, function(idx, v) {\n            section = $(v);\n            var div_id = $(section).attr('id');\n            var div_text = section.text().split('¶')[0];\n            var parent = $(\"#\" + div_id)\n            var content = '<li id=\"link_' + div_id + '\" class=\"md-nav__item\"><a class=\"md-nav__link\" href=\"#' + div_id + '\" title=\"' + div_text +'\">' + div_text +'</a></li>';\n            $(toc).append(content);\n\n            // Add section code to subnavigation\n            var children = $('<nav class=\"md-nav\"><ul class=\"md-nav__list\"></nav></ul>')\n            var contenders = $(\"#\" + div_id).nextUntil(\"h1\");\n            $.each(contenders, function(idx, contender){\n               if($(contender).is('h2') || $(contender).is('h3')) {\n                   var contender_id = $(contender).attr('id');\n                   var contender_text = $(contender).text().split('¶')[0];\n                   var content = '<li class=\"md-nav__item\"><a class=\"md-nav__link\" href=\"#' + contender_id + '\" title=\"' + contender_text +'\">' + contender_text +'</a></li>';\n                   children.append(content);\n                }\n             })\n             $(\"#link_\" + div_id).append(children);\n        });\n    });\n</script>\n\n<script>\nvar headers = [\"h1\", \"h2\", \"h3\", \"h4\"]\nvar colors = [\"red\", \"orange\", \"green\", \"blue\"]\n\n$.each(headers, function(i, header){\n    var color = colors[i];\n    $(header).each(function () {\n        var href=$(this).attr(\"id\");\n        $(this).append('<a class=\"headerlink\" style=\"color:' + color + '\" href=\"#' + href + '\" title=\"Permanent link\">¶</a>')\n    });\n})\n</script>\n\n\n\n\n              \n              <br>\n\n\n           </div>\n          </main>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <footer class=\"bg-dark pt-3 row d-print-none\">\n  <div class=\"container-fluid mx-sm-5\">\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2\">\n        \n\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3\">\n<ul class=\"list-inline mb-0\">  \n  <li class=\"list-inline-item mx-2 h3\" data-toggle=\"tooltip\" data-placement=\"top\" title=\"\" aria-label=\"GitHub\" data-original-title=\"GitHub\">\n    <a class=\"text-white\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/ept/crdt-website\">\n      <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n    </a>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2\">\n  <small class=\"text-white\">\n    This site is maintained by Martin Kleppmann, Annette Bieniusa, and Marc Shapiro.\n    If you find any problems or want to add something, please\n    <a href=\"https://github.com/ept/crdt-website/issues/new\">open an issue or PR</a>.\n    The theme is based on <a href=\"https://vsoch.github.io/docsy-jekyll/\">Docsy Jekyll</a>.\n  </small>\n  \n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</footer>\n\n    </div>\n    <script src=\"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js\" integrity=\"sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy\" crossorigin=\"anonymous\"></script>\n<script src=\"/assets/js/main.js\"></script>\n\n  \n\n","text":"Conflict-free Replicated Data Types\nGitHub\nAbout CRDTs\nResources\nPapers\nImplementations\nCRDT Glossary\nCommunity\nEdit this page Create issue\nAbout CRDTs\nAbout CRDTs¶\nA Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that\nsimplifies distributed data storage systems and multi-user applications.\nIn many systems, copies of some data need to be stored on multiple computers\n(known as replicas).

In this article, I’ll show you which dependencies to mock, and which to use as is in your tests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_what_is_a_mock\">What is a mock?</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Before jumping to the topic of when to mock, let’s discuss what a mock is.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sidebarblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<div class=\"title\">Mock vs test double</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>People often use the terms <em>test double</em> and <em>mock</em> as synonyms, but technically, they are not:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>test double</strong> is an overarching term that describes all kinds of non-production-ready, fake dependencies in tests. Such a dependency looks and behaves like its release-intended counterpart but is actually a simplified version that reduces complexity and facilitates testing.</p>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This term was introduced by Gerard Meszaros in his book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/xUnit-Test-Patterns-Refactoring-Code/dp/0131495054\">xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code</a>. The name itself comes from the notion of a stunt double in movies.</p>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>mock</strong> is just one kind of such dependencies.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>According to Gerard Meszaros, there are 5 types of test doubles:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Dummy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stub</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spy</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Mock</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fake</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Such a variety may look intimidating, but in reality, they can all be grouped together into just two types: mocks and stubs.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/2020/2020-04-13-mocks-and-stubs.png\" alt=\"2020 04 13 mocks and stubs\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"title\">All variations of test doubles can be categorized into two types: mocks and stubs</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The difference between these two types boils down to the following:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Mocks help to emulate and examine <strong>outcoming</strong> interactions. These interactions are calls the system under test (SUT) makes to its dependencies to change their state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stubs help to emulate <strong>incoming</strong> interactions. These interactions are calls the SUT makes to its dependencies to get input data.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>For example, sending an email is an outcoming interaction: that interaction results in a side effect in the SMTP server. A test double emulating such an interaction is a mock.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Retrieving data from the database is an incoming interaction — it doesn’t result in a side effect. The corresponding test double is a stub.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/2020/2020-04-13-incoming-outcoming.png\" alt=\"2020 04 13 incoming outcoming\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"title\">Mocks are for outcoming interaction; stubs — for incoming</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>All other differences between the five types of test doubles are insignificant implementation details:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Spies</strong> serve the same role as mocks. The distinction is that spies are written manually, whereas mocks are created with the help of a mocking framework. Sometimes people refer to spies as <strong>handwritten mocks</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>On the other hand, the difference between stubs, dummies, and fakes is in how intelligent they are:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"ulist\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>dummy</strong> is a simple, hard-coded value such as a <code>null</code> value or a made-up string. It’s used to satisfy the SUT’s method signature and doesn’t participate in producing the final outcome.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>stub</strong> is more sophisticated. It’s a fully fledged dependency that you configure to return different values for different scenarios.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A <strong>fake</strong> is the same as a stub for most purposes. The difference is in the rationale for its creation: a fake is usually implemented to replace a dependency that doesn’t yet exist.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Notice the difference between mocks and stubs (aside from outcoming versus incoming interactions). Mocks help to <strong>emulate and examine</strong> interactions between the SUT and its dependencies, while stubs only help to <strong>emulate</strong> those interactions. This is an important distinction. You will see why shortly.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_mock_the_tool_vs_mock_the_test_double\">Mock-the-tool vs. mock-the-test-double</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The term <em>mock</em> is overloaded and can mean different things in different circumstances. I mentioned already that people often use this term to mean any test double, whereas mocks are only a subset of test doubles.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>But there’s another meaning for the term <em>mock</em>. You can refer to the classes from mocking libraries as mocks, too.

A call from the SUT to a stub is not part of the end result the SUT produces. Such a call is only a means to produce the end result; it’s an implementation detail. Asserting interactions with stubs is a common anti-pattern that leads to brittle tests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The only way to avoid test brittleness is to make those tests verify the end result (which, ideally, should be meaningful to a non-programmer), not implementation details.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>In the above examples, the check</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"chroma\"><code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"n\">mock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Verify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">SendGreetingsEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"user@email.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>corresponds to an actual outcome, and that outcome is meaningful to a domain expert: sending a greetings email is something business people would want the system to do.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>At the same time, the call to <code>GetNumberOfUsers()</code> is not an outcome at all. It’s an internal implementation detail regarding how the SUT gathers data necessary for the report creation. Therefore, asserting this call would lead to test fragility.

These collaborations don’t have an immediate connection to the client’s goal. Thus, coupling to such collaborations leads to fragile tests.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Inter-system communications are a different matter. Unlike collaborations between classes inside your application, the way your system talks to the external world forms the observable behavior of that system as a whole. It’s part of the contract your application must hold at all times.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/2020/2020-04-14-inter-intra-2.png\" alt=\"2020 04 14 inter intra 2\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"title\">Intra-system communications are implementation details; inter-system communications form the observable behavior of your application as a whole</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>This attribute of inter-system communications stems from the way separate applications evolve together. One of the main principles of such an evolution is maintaining backward compatibility. Regardless of the refactorings you perform inside your system, the communication pattern it uses to talk to external applications should always stay in place, so that external applications can understand it. For example, messages your application emits on a bus should preserve their structure, the calls issued to an SMTP service should have the same number and type of parameters, and so on.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><mark>The use of mocks cements the communication pattern between the system under test and the dependency (makes that pattern harder to change).</mark> This is <strong><em>exactly</em></strong> what you want when verifying communications between your system and external applications. Conversely, using mocks to verify communications between classes inside your system couples your tests to implementation details, making them fragile.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Intra-system communications correspond to mutable in-process dependencies:</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/2020/2020-04-14-dependencies.png\" alt=\"2020 04 14 dependencies\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"title\">Intra-system communications are communications with mutable in-process dependencies</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>And so, the London school is wrong because it encourages the use of mocks for all mutable dependencies and doesn’t differentiate between intra-system (in-process) and inter-system (out-of-process) communications.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>As a result, tests check communications between classes just as much as they check communications between your application and external systems. This indiscriminate use of mocks is why following the London school often results in fragile tests — tests that couple to implementation details.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"sect1\">\n<h2 id=\"_don_t_mock_all_out_of_process_dependencies\">Don’t mock all out-of-process dependencies</h2>\n<div class=\"sectionbody\">\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>The classical school is better at this issue because it advocates for substituting only out-of-process dependencies such as an SMTP service, a message bus, and so on. But the classical school is not ideal in its treatment of inter-system communications, either. This school also encourages excessive use of mocks, albeit not as much as the London school.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Not all out-of-process dependencies should be mocked out. <mark>If an out-of-process dependency is only accessible through your application, then communications with such a dependency are not part of your system’s observable behavior.</mark> An out-of-process dependency that can’t be observed externally, in effect, acts as part of your application. Communications with such a dependency become implementation details: they don’t have to stay in place after refactoring and therefore shouldn’t be verified with mocks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"imageblock\">\n<div class=\"content\">\n<img src=\"/images/2020/2020-04-14-inter-intra-3.png\" alt=\"2020 04 14 inter intra 3\">\n</div>\n<div class=\"title\">Some inter-system communications are implementation details too</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>Remember, the requirement to always preserve the communication pattern between your application and external systems stems from the necessity to maintain backward compatibility. You have to maintain the way your application talks to external systems. That’s because you can’t change those external systems simultaneously with your application; they may follow a different deployment cycle, or you might simply not have control over them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>But when your application acts as a proxy to an external system, and no client can access it directly, the backward-compatibility requirement vanishes. Now you can deploy your application together with this external system, and it won’t affect the clients. The communication pattern with such a system becomes an implementation detail.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p>A good example here is an application database: a database that is used only by your application. No external system has access to this database. Therefore, you can modify the communication pattern between your system and the application database in any way you like, as long as it doesn’t break existing functionality. Because that database is completely hidden from the eyes of the clients, you can even replace it with an entirely different storage mechanism, and no one will notice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"paragraph\">\n<p><mark>The use of mocks for out-of-process dependencies that you have a full control over also leads to brittle tests</mark>. You don’t want your tests to turn red every time you split a table in the database or modify the type of one of the parameters in a stored procedure.

These dependencies are only accessible through your application; interactions with them aren’t visible to the external world. A typical example is the application database.

I remember how, throughout my programming career, I went from mocking almost every dependency, to the \"no-mocks\" policy, and then to \"only mock external dependencies\".\nNone of this practices are good enough. In this article, I’ll show you which dependencies to mock, and which to use as is in your tests.\nWhat is a mock?\nBefore jumping to the topic of when to mock, let’s discuss what a mock is.\nMock vs test double\nPeople often use the terms test double and mock as synonyms, but technically, they are not:\nA test double is an overarching term that describes all kinds of non-production-ready, fake dependencies in tests. Such a dependency looks and behaves like its release-intended counterpart but is actually a simplified version that reduces complexity and facilitates testing.\nThis term was introduced by Gerard Meszaros in his book xUnit Test Patterns: Refactoring Test Code. The name itself comes from the notion of a stunt double in movies.\nA mock is just one kind of such dependencies.\nAccording to Gerard Meszaros, there are 5 types of test doubles:\nDummy\nStub\nSpy\nMock\nFake\nSuch a variety may look intimidating, but in reality, they can all be grouped together into just two types: mocks and stubs.\nAll variations of test doubles can be categorized into two types: mocks and stubs\nThe difference between these two types boils down to the following:\nMocks help to emulate and examine outcoming interactions. These interactions are calls the system under test (SUT) makes to its dependencies to change their state.\nStubs help to emulate incoming interactions. These interactions are calls the SUT makes to its dependencies to get input data.\nFor example, sending an email is an outcoming interaction: that interaction results in a side effect in the SMTP server. A test double emulating such an interaction is a mock.\nRetrieving data from the database is an incoming interaction — it doesn’t result in a side effect. The corresponding test double is a stub.\nMocks are for outcoming interaction; stubs — for incoming\nAll other differences between the five types of test doubles are insignificant implementation details:\nSpies serve the same role as mocks. The distinction is that spies are written manually, whereas mocks are created with the help of a mocking framework. Sometimes people refer to spies as handwritten mocks.\nOn the other hand, the difference between stubs, dummies, and fakes is in how intelligent they are:\nA dummy is a simple, hard-coded value such as a null value or a made-up string. It’s used to satisfy the SUT’s method signature and doesn’t participate in producing the final outcome.\nA stub is more sophisticated. It’s a fully fledged dependency that you configure to return different values for different scenarios.\nA fake is the same as a stub for most purposes. The difference is in the rationale for its creation: a fake is usually implemented to replace a dependency that doesn’t yet exist.\nNotice the difference between mocks and stubs (aside from outcoming versus incoming interactions). Mocks help to emulate and examine interactions between the SUT and its dependencies, while stubs only help to emulate those interactions. This is an important distinction. You will see why shortly.\nMock-the-tool vs. mock-the-test-double\nThe term mock is overloaded and can mean different things in different circumstances. I mentioned already that people often use this term to mean any test double, whereas mocks are only a subset of test doubles.\nBut there’s another meaning for the term mock. You can refer to the classes from mocking libraries as mocks, too. These classes help you create actual mocks, but they themselves are not mocks per se:\n<code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"na\">[Fact]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">public</span> <span class=\"k\">void</span> <span class=\"n\">Sending_a_greetings_email</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Using a mock-the-tool to create a mock-the-test-double\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">mock</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Mock</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">IEmailGateway</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;();</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">mock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">GreetUser</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"user@email.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Examining the call from the SUT to the test double\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"n\">mock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Verify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">SendGreetingsEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"user@email.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">Times</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Once</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code>\nThis test uses the Mock class from the Moq mocking library. This class is a tool that enables you to create a test double — a mock. In other words, the class Mock (or Mock&lt;IEmailGateway&gt;) is a mock-the-tool, while the instance of that class, mock, is a mock-the-test-double.\nIt’s important not to conflate a mock-the-tool with a mock-the-test-double because you can use a mock-the-tool to create both types of test doubles: mocks and stubs.\nHere’s another example of a test that uses the Mock class. The instance of that class is a stub, not mock:\n<code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"na\">[Fact]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">public</span> <span class=\"k\">void</span> <span class=\"n\">Creating_a_report</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Using a mock-the-tool to create a stub\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">stub</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Mock</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">IDatabase</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;();</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Setting up a canned answer\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"n\">stub</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Setup</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">GetNumberOfUsers</span><span class=\"p\">()).</span><span class=\"n\">Returns</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"m\">10</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stub</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"n\">Report</span> <span class=\"n\">report</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">CreateReport</span><span class=\"p\">();</span> <span class=\"n\">Assert</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Equal</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"m\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">report</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">NumberOfUsers</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code>\nThis test double emulates an incoming interaction — a call that provides the SUT with input data.\nOn the other hand, in the previous example, the call to SendGreetingsEmail() is an outcoming interaction. Its sole purpose is to incur a side effect — send an email.\nDon’t assert interactions with stubs\nAs I mentioned above, mocks help to emulate and examine outcoming interactions between the SUT and its dependencies, while stubs only help to emulate incoming interactions, not examine them.\nThe difference between the two stems from this guideline: you should never assert interactions with stubs. A call from the SUT to a stub is not part of the end result the SUT produces. Such a call is only a means to produce the end result; it’s an implementation detail. Asserting interactions with stubs is a common anti-pattern that leads to brittle tests.\nThe only way to avoid test brittleness is to make those tests verify the end result (which, ideally, should be meaningful to a non-programmer), not implementation details.\nIn the above examples, the check\n<code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"n\">mock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Verify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">SendGreetingsEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"user@email.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code>\ncorresponds to an actual outcome, and that outcome is meaningful to a domain expert: sending a greetings email is something business people would want the system to do.\nAt the same time, the call to GetNumberOfUsers() is not an outcome at all. It’s an internal implementation detail regarding how the SUT gathers data necessary for the report creation. Therefore, asserting this call would lead to test fragility. It doesn’t matter how the SUT generates the end result, as long as that result is correct.\nHere’s an example of such a fragile test:\n<code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"na\">[Fact]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">public</span> <span class=\"k\">void</span> <span class=\"n\">Creating_a_report</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">stub</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Mock</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">IDatabase</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;();</span> <span class=\"n\">stub</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Setup</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">GetNumberOfUsers</span><span class=\"p\">()).</span><span class=\"n\">Returns</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"m\">10</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Controller</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">stub</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"n\">Report</span> <span class=\"n\">report</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">CreateReport</span><span class=\"p\">();</span> <span class=\"n\">Assert</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Equal</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"m\">10</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">report</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">NumberOfUsers</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Asserting an interaction with a stub\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"n\">stub</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Verify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">GetNumberOfUsers</span><span class=\"p\">(),</span> <span class=\"n\">Times</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Once</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code>\nThis practice of verifying things that aren’t part of the end result is also called overspecification. Most commonly, overspecification takes place when examining interactions. Checking for interactions with stubs is a flaw that’s quite easy to spot because tests shouldn’t check for any interactions with stubs.\nMocks are a more complicated subject: not all uses of mocks lead to test fragility, but a lot of them do. You’ll see why shortly.\nUsing mocks and stubs together\nSometimes you need to create a test double that exhibits the properties of both a mock and a stub:\n<code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"na\">[Fact]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">public</span> <span class=\"k\">void</span> <span class=\"n\">Purchase_fails_when_not_enough_inventory</span><span class=\"p\">()</span>\n<span class=\"p\">{</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">storeMock</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Mock</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">IStore</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;();</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Setting up a canned answer\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"n\">storeMock</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Setup</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">HasEnoughInventory</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Product</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Shampoo</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"m\">5</span><span class=\"p\">))</span> <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Returns</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"k\">false</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Customer</span><span class=\"p\">();</span> <span class=\"kt\">bool</span> <span class=\"n\">success</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">sut</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Purchase</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">storeMock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Object</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">Product</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Shampoo</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"m\">5</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"n\">Assert</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">False</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">success</span><span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"c1\">// Examining a call from the SUT to the mock\n</span><span class=\"c1\"></span> <span class=\"n\">storeMock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Verify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">RemoveInventory</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">Product</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Shampoo</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"m\">5</span><span class=\"p\">),</span> <span class=\"n\">Times</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Never</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code>\nThis test uses storeMock for two purposes: it returns a canned answer and verifies a method call made by the SUT.\nNotice, though, that these are two different methods: the test sets up the answer from HasEnoughInventory() but then verifies the call to RemoveInventory(). Thus, the rule of not asserting interactions with stubs is not violated here.\nWhen a test double is both a mock and a stub, it’s still called a mock, not a stub. That’s mostly because you need to pick one name, but also because being a mock is a more important fact than being a stub.\nMocks vs. stubs and commands vs. queries\nThe notion of mocks and stubs ties to the command query separation (CQS) principle. The CQS principle states that every method should be either a command or a query, but not both:\nCommands are methods that produce side effects and don’t return any value (return void). Examples of side effects include mutating an object’s state, changing a file in the file system, and so on.\nQueries are the opposite of that — they are side-effect free and return a value.\nIn other words, asking a question should not change the answer. Code that maintains such a clear separation becomes easier to read.\nTest doubles that substitute commands become mocks. Similarly, test doubles that substitute queries are stubs:\nCommands correspond to mocks; queries — to stubs\nLook at the two tests from the previous examples again (I’m showing their relevant parts here):\n<code class=\"language-csharp\" data-lang=\"csharp\"><span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">mock</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Mock</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">IEmailGateway</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;();</span>\n<span class=\"n\">mock</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Verify</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">SendGreetingsEmail</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">\"user@email.com\"</span><span class=\"p\">));</span> <span class=\"kt\">var</span> <span class=\"n\">stub</span> <span class=\"p\">=</span> <span class=\"k\">new</span> <span class=\"n\">Mock</span><span class=\"p\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">IDatabase</span><span class=\"p\">&gt;();</span>\n<span class=\"n\">stub</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">Setup</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">x</span> <span class=\"p\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"n\">x</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">GetNumberOfUsers</span><span class=\"p\">()).</span><span class=\"n\">Returns</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"m\">10</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</code>\nSendGreetingsEmail() is a command whose side effect is sending an email. The test double that substitutes this command is a mock.\nOn the other hand, GetNumberOfUsers() is a query that returns a value and doesn’t mutate the database state. The corresponding test double is a stub.\nWhen to mock\nWith all these definitions out of the way, let’s talk about when you should use mocks.\nYou obviously don’t want to mock the system under test (SUT) itself, so the question of \"When to mock?\" boils down to this: \"Which types of dependencies you should replace with a mock, and which — use as is in tests?\"\nHere are all types of unit testing dependencies I listed in the previous article:\nTypes of unit testing dependencies\nTo re-iterate:\nA shared dependency is a dependency that is shared between tests and provides means for those tests to affect each other’s outcome.\nA private dependency is any dependency that is not shared.\nA shared dependency corresponds to a mutable out-of-process dependency in the vast majority of cases, that’s why I’m using these two notions as synonyms here. (Check out my previous post for more details: Unit Testing Dependencies: The Complete Guide.)\nThere are two schools of unit testing with their own views on which types of dependencies to replace with mocks:\nThe London school (also known as the mockist school) advocates for replacing all mutable dependencies (collaborators) with mocks.\nThe classical school (also known as the Detroit school) advocates for the replacement of only shared (mutable out-of-process) dependencies.\nTypes of unit testing dependencies and the schools of unit testing\nBoth schools are wrong in their treatment of mocks, though the classical school is less so than the London school.\nMocks and immutable out-of-process dependencies\nWhat about immutable out-of-process dependencies? Shouldn’t they be mocked out too, according to at least one of the schools?\nImmutable out-of-process dependencies (such as a read-only API service), should be replaced with a test double, but that test double would be a stub, not a mock.\nThat’s, once again, due to the differences between mocks and stubs:\nMocks are for outcoming interactions (commands) — interactions that leave a side effect in the dependency-collaborator.\nStubs are for incoming interactions (queries) — interactions that don’t leave a side effect in the dependency.\nInteractions with immutable out-of-process dependencies are, by definition, incoming and thus shouldn’t be checked for in tests, only stubbed out with canned answers (both schools are OK with that).\nI’ll first describe why the London school is wrong, and then — why the classical approach is wrong too.\nDon’t mock all mutable dependencies\nYou shouldn’t mock all mutable dependencies. To see why, we need to look at two types of communications in a typical application: intra-system and inter-system.\nIntra-system communications are communications between classes inside your application\nInter-system communications are when your application talks to other applications.\nHere they are on a diagram:\nIntra-system and inter-system communications\nThere’s a huge difference between the two: intra-system communications are implementation details; inter-system communications are not.\nIntra-system communications are implementation details because the collaborations your domain classes go through in order to perform an operation are not part of their observable behavior. These collaborations don’t have an immediate connection to the client’s goal. Thus, coupling to such collaborations leads to fragile tests.\nInter-system communications are a different matter. Unlike collaborations between classes inside your application, the way your system talks to the external world forms the observable behavior of that system as a whole. It’s part of the contract your application must hold at all times.\nIntra-system communications are implementation details; inter-system communications form the observable behavior of your application as a whole\nThis attribute of inter-system communications stems from the way separate applications evolve together. One of the main principles of such an evolution is maintaining backward compatibility. Regardless of the refactorings you perform inside your system, the communication pattern it uses to talk to external applications should always stay in place, so that external applications can understand it. For example, messages your application emits on a bus should preserve their structure, the calls issued to an SMTP service should have the same number and type of parameters, and so on.\nThe use of mocks cements the communication pattern between the system under test and the dependency (makes that pattern harder to change). This is exactly what you want when verifying communications between your system and external applications. Conversely, using mocks to verify communications between classes inside your system couples your tests to implementation details, making them fragile.\nIntra-system communications correspond to mutable in-process dependencies:\nIntra-system communications are communications with mutable in-process dependencies\nAnd so, the London school is wrong because it encourages the use of mocks for all mutable dependencies and doesn’t differentiate between intra-system (in-process) and inter-system (out-of-process) communications.\nAs a result, tests check communications between classes just as much as they check communications between your application and external systems. This indiscriminate use of mocks is why following the London school often results in fragile tests — tests that couple to implementation details.\nDon’t mock all out-of-process dependencies\nThe classical school is better at this issue because it advocates for substituting only out-of-process dependencies such as an SMTP service, a message bus, and so on. But the classical school is not ideal in its treatment of inter-system communications, either. This school also encourages excessive use of mocks, albeit not as much as the London school.\nNot all out-of-process dependencies should be mocked out. If an out-of-process dependency is only accessible through your application, then communications with such a dependency are not part of your system’s observable behavior. An out-of-process dependency that can’t be observed externally, in effect, acts as part of your application. Communications with such a dependency become implementation details: they don’t have to stay in place after refactoring and therefore shouldn’t be verified with mocks.\nSome inter-system communications are implementation details too\nRemember, the requirement to always preserve the communication pattern between your application and external systems stems from the necessity to maintain backward compatibility. You have to maintain the way your application talks to external systems. That’s because you can’t change those external systems simultaneously with your application; they may follow a different deployment cycle, or you might simply not have control over them.\nBut when your application acts as a proxy to an external system, and no client can access it directly, the backward-compatibility requirement vanishes. Now you can deploy your application together with this external system, and it won’t affect the clients. The communication pattern with such a system becomes an implementation detail.\nA good example here is an application database: a database that is used only by your application. No external system has access to this database. Therefore, you can modify the communication pattern between your system and the application database in any way you like, as long as it doesn’t break existing functionality. Because that database is completely hidden from the eyes of the clients, you can even replace it with an entirely different storage mechanism, and no one will notice.\nThe use of mocks for out-of-process dependencies that you have a full control over also leads to brittle tests. You don’t want your tests to turn red every time you split a table in the database or modify the type of one of the parameters in a stored procedure. The database and your application must be treated as one system.\nThis distinction splits out-of-process dependencies into two subcategories:\nManaged dependencies — out-of-process dependencies you have full control over. These dependencies are only accessible through your application; interactions with them aren’t visible to the external world. A typical example is the application database. External systems don’t access your database directly; they do that through the API your application provides.\nUnmanaged dependencies — out-of-process dependencies you don’t have full control over. Interactions with such dependencies are observable externally. Examples include an SMTP server and a message bus: both produce side effects visible to other applications.\nOnly unmanaged dependencies should be replaced with mocks. Use real instances of managed dependencies in tests.\nOnly unmanaged dependencies can be replaced with mocks\nFurther reading\nOf course, using real instances of managed dependencies in tests poses an obvious issue: how do you test them such that your tests remain fast and reliable?\nYou’ll see this subject covered in depth in my book:\nUnit Testing Principles, Practices, and Patterns\nSummary\nTest double is an overarching term that describes all kinds of non-production-ready, fake dependencies in tests.\nThere are five variations of test doubles — dummy, stub, spy, mock, and fake — that can be grouped in just two types: mocks and stubs.\nSpies are functionally the same as mocks; dummies and fakes serve the same role as stubs.\nThe differences between mocks vs stubs:\nMocks help emulate and examine outcoming interactions: calls from the SUT to its dependencies that change the state of those dependencies.\nStubs help emulate incoming interactions: calls the SUT makes to its dependencies to get input data.\nAsserting interactions with stubs always leads to fragile tests.\nTest doubles that substitute CQS commands are mocks. Test doubles that substitute CQS queries are stubs.\nA mock-the-tool is a class from a mocking library that you can use to create a mock-the-test-double or a stub.\nOut-of-process dependencies can be categorized into 2 subcategories: managed and unmanaged dependencies.\nManaged dependencies are out-of-process dependencies that are only accessible through your application. Interactions with managed dependencies aren’t observable externally. A typical example is the application database.\nUnmanaged dependencies are out-of-process dependencies that other applications have access to. Interactions with unmanaged dependencies are observable externally. Typical examples include an SMTP server and a message bus.\nCommunications with managed dependencies are implementation details; communications with unmanaged dependencies are part of your system’s observable behavior.\nUse real instances of managed dependencies in integration tests; replace unmanaged dependencies with mocks.\nRelated\nUnit Testing Dependencies: The Complete Guide\n← Unit Testing Dependencies: The Complete Guide\nSubscribe\nI don't post everything on my blog.
